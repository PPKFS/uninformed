Lab is a room.

The library computer is in the lab.

Understand "alpha/beta/gamma/--" as "[greek]".

Understand "google [greek] for/aboot/-- [text] in/on [library computer]" as
consulting it about (with nouns reversed).

Test me with "google for fish on the computer / google alpha for fish on the
computer / google beta for fish on the computer / google gamma for fish on
the computer / google fish on the computer".
