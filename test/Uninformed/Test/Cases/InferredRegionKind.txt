A crowd is a kind of people. It is usually plural-named and undescribed.
It has a region called territory.

Region 1 is a region. Region 2 is a region in Region 1.

QR is a region that varies. QR is Region 1.

WR is initially Region 1.

A room called Room 1 is in Region 2.

Crowd 2 is here. It is a crowd. The territory of Crowd 2 is Region 1.

A room called Room 2 is in Region 2 and north of Room 1.

Every turn:
	let R be Region 1;
	showme R;
	say "R is [R]...";
	if the location is in Region 1 :
		say "Check (1a).";
	if the location is in R:
		say "Check (1b).";
	if the location is in the territory of Crowd 2:
		say "Check (1c).";
	if the location is in QR:
		say "Check (1d).";
	if the location is in WR:
		say "Check (1e).";

Test me with "showme / n / showme".
