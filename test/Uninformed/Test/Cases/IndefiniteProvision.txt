A person has a number called IQ.

The Lab is a room. John is a man in the Lab.

To say foo (C - sayable value):
	say "Foo [C]".
To say foo (C - sayable value that provides the property IQ):
	say "Other Foo [C]".
When play begins:
	let X be an object;
	let Y be the Lab;
	let Z be John;
	say "[foo seven], [foo yourself], [foo John], [foo X], [foo Y], [foo Z].";
