Place is a room.

A fixed in place supporter called a stone altar is in Place. A statuette is on the altar. A container 
called an ancient basket is on the altar. A mysterious book is on the altar.

Some straw and some loose rocks are in Place.

A thing called a crystal is on the stone altar. "A beautiful, glowing crystal lies upon [a stone 
altar]."

test me with "look / x altar / jump / look"

After jumping:
	now the stone altar is scenery;
	say "(Altar is now given scenery property.)[line break]".
