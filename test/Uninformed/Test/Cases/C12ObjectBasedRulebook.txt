The Pumping House is a room. A well is a fixed in place container in
the Pumping House. The cork, the rubber ring and a lead ingot are in
the Pumping House.

A thing can be inflated or uninflated. A thing is usually uninflated.
Before printing the name of an inflated thing: say "inflated ".

The rubber ring is inflated.

The flotation rules are an object-based rulebook.

A flotation rule for the cork: rule succeeds.
A flotation rule for an inflated thing: rule succeeds.
A flotation rule: rule fails.
A flotation rule when the big switch is switched on: rule fails.

A big switch is a fixed in place device in the Pumping House. "A big
switch labelled: MAKE EVERYTHING SINK is mounted on one wall."

After inserting something into the well:
	follow the flotation rules for the noun;
	if the rule succeeded
	begin;
		say "[The noun] bobs on the surface.";
	otherwise;
		now the noun is nowhere;
		say "[The noun] sinks out of sight.";
	end if.

Test me with "get all / put cork in well / put ring in well / put
ingot in well / x well / get cork / get ring / switch switch on / put
cork in well / put ring in well / x well".
