The Garden is a room.
 
A fruit dispenser is here.
 
A container called the glass box is part of the fruit dispenser. It is
closed and transparent.

An apple is in the glass box.

The sky is a backdrop. It is in the Garden. The flock of geese is part of
the sky. It is an animal.

The hot air balloon is part of the sky. It is a vehicle. The picnic basket
is a container in the hot air balloon.

Test me with "push apple / push basket / enter balloon / push basket".
