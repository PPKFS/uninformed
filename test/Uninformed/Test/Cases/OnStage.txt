Stage is a room. A meteor, a stone, and a long glass of sherbet are in Stage. 

Instead of waiting:
	now the stone is off-stage.

Instead of jumping:
	now the stone is on-stage.

Every turn:
	if the stone is on-stage, say "The stone is on-stage.";
	if the stone is off-stage, say "The stone is off-stage.";

Test me with "look / z / look / jump / get stone / jump / look / i".
