Moon is a room. A rock is a thing.

An astronaut is a kind of person.

Neil Armstrong is an astronaut in the Moon.
Buzz Aldrin is an astronaut in the Moon.

After looking:
	say "[List of astronauts who are not carrying something] are carrying nothing.";
	say "In other words: [list of astronauts who are carrying nothing] are empty-handed.";

Instead of waiting:
	say "Buzz picks up a rock.";
	now Buzz is carrying the rock.

Test me with "look / z / look".
