[This tests a tricky race condition between the provision of an I6 equivalent
of the property "other side" = "door_to", and the setting of schemas to
express the relation "to be through".]

The magic door is north of the starting room. The magic door is a door.
The first room is through the magic door.
The second room is a room.

When play begins:
	now the second room is through the magic door.

Test me with "open door/enter door".
