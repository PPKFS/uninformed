Fatherhood relates one person to various people. The verb to engender (he
engenders, they engender) implies the fatherhood relation. 

The Study is a room.

Nigel, Bill, Bob and Brian are people in the Study.

Bill engenders Bob. Bob engenders Brian.

Instead of attacking someone:
	say "From [noun] to [Brian] is [the number of steps via the fatherhood
		relation from the noun to Brian].";
	say "From [Brian] to [noun] is [the number of steps via the fatherhood
		relation from the Brian to noun].";
	if the number of steps via the fatherhood relation from the noun to brian
		is greater than 0, say "Brian steps in and stops you.
		'None of that,' he says. 'Don't hit my ancestor.'";
	if the number of steps via the fatherhood relation from the noun to brian
		is -1, say "Brian waves a hand. 'Go right ahead,' he says."

Test me with "hit bill / hit bob / hit brian / hit nigel".
