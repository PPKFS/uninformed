The Wabe is a room.

The blue peacock and the sundial are in the Wabe.

The blue peacock is privately-named. Understand "bird" as the peacock.

The drawer is in the Wabe.

The secret document is a privately-named thing in the drawer.

The printed name of the secret document is "[if the secret document is
handled]secret document[otherwise]dusty paper".

Understand "dusty" and "paper" as the secret document.

Understand "secret" and "document" as the secret document when the
secret document is handled.

After taking the secret document for the first time: say "Heavens! It
is the secret document!"

Test me with "x blue / x peacock / x sundial / x bird / x dusty paper
/ x secret document / get dusty paper / x secret document".
