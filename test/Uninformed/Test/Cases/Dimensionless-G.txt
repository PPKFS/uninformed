Length is a kind of value. 1m specifies a length. 1mm specifies a length
scaled down by 1000. 1cm specifies a length scaled down by 100. 1km
specifies a length scaled up by 1000.

Area is a kind of value. 1 sq m specifies an area. 1 sq cm specifies an
area scaled down by 10000. 1 hectare specifies an area scaled up by 10000.
Length times length specifies an area.

A volume is a kind of value. 1 cu m specifies a volume. 1cc specifies
a volume scaled down by 1000000. Length times area specifies a volume.

An angle is a kind of value. 1 radian specifies an angle. Length times
angle specifies a length.

A solid angle is a kind of value. 1 steradian specifies a solid angle.
Area times solid angle specifies an area.
