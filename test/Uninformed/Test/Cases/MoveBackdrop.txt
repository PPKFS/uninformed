The Upper Cave is above the Rock Pool.

The stream is a backdrop. It is in the Upper Cave and the Ledge.

The Ledge is east of the Pool.

Definition: A room is wet if it is the Rock Pool or it is the Ledge.

When play begins:
	move the stream backdrop to all wet rooms.

Test me with "x stream / d / x stream / e / x stream".
