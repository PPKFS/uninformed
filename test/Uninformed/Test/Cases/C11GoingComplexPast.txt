The Dome is a room. The striplamp is in the Dome. The striplamp is not lit.
The Dome is south from the Dome.

Before going south from the Dome: if the striplamp has been dark for at
least two turns, say "if condition."

Before going south from the Dome when the striplamp has been dark for at
least two turns: say "when condition."

Before going south from the Dome [when the striplamp has been dark] for at
least two turns: say "when condition without."

Every turn: if the striplamp has been dark, say "It has been dark."

Every turn when the striplamp has been dark, say "It has really been dark."

Test me with "actions/z/z/s".
