Lab is a room.
A theme is a kind of thing. Love is a theme. Loss is a theme. Lust is a theme.
Suggesting relates various themes to each other with fast route-finding. The verb to suggest (he suggests, 
they suggest, he suggested, it is suggested, he is suggesting) implies the suggesting relation. Love 
suggests Loss. Loss suggests Love. Loss suggests Lust. Lust suggests Loss.

Every turn: say "[The next step via the suggesting relation from Love to Lust]."

Test me with "z".
