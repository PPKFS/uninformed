Foo is a room.

Ullage is a kind of value. 1.0U specifies an ullage.
Bullage is a kind of value. 1.0B specifies a bullage.
Qullage is a kind of value. 1.0Q specifies a qullage.
Ullage times ullage specifies a bullage.
Bullage times bullage specifies a qullage.

Equation - Stefan-Boltzmann Law
	P = T^4
where P is a qullage and T is an ullage.

When play begins:
	let P be 16Q;
	let T be given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law;
	say "[T]."
