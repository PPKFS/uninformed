The Reliquary is a room. The wooden door is a door.  The wooden door is inside from the Reliquary 
and outside from the Crypt.
The ghost is a person in the Reliquary.

Instead of going north: try the ghost closing the wooden door.

Every turn: say "The ghost can[if the ghost cannot touch the wooden door]not[end if] touch the wooden 
door."

The handle is part of the wooden door. Instead of an actor turning the handle: try the person asked opening 
the wooden door.

Instead of jumping: try the ghost turning the handle.

Test me with "actions/z/in/n/jump".
