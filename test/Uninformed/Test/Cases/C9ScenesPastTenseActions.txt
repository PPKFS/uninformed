The Desert is a room. "These new optical-reflection-triggered bombs
are a nightmare. Be careful." The mysterious object is a thing in the
desert. The description is "Oh n---".

Dangerous Times is a scene. Dangerous Times begins when play begins.
Dangerous Times ends when we have examined the mysterious object.
When Dangerous Times ends: end the story saying "You have died".

Test me with "scenes/z/z/x object".
