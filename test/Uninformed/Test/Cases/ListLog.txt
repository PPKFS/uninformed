The Brahms Conservatoire is a room. The piano, the oboe, the bassoon,
the French horn, the clarinet, the xylophone, the tuba, the trombone,
the case and the triangle are in the Conservatoire. The violin is in the case.

The most-recently-taken list is a list of objects that varies.
Carry out taking something (called the item):
	truncate the most-recently-taken list to the last 6 entries;
	add the item to the most-recently-taken list.

After taking:
	say "Taken. (So, your recent acquisitions: [most-recently-taken list].)"

Test me with "take all".
