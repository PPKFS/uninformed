The Tool Room is a room.

A switched on device called a blue button is here.

A switched off device called a red button is here.

When play begins:
     if all but one of the devices are switched on, say "All but one of the devices are switched on.";
     if all except one of the devices are switched on, say "All except one of the devices are switched on."
