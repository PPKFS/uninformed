Length is a kind of value. 1m specifies a length. 1mm specifies a length
scaled down by 1000. 1cm specifies a length scaled down by 100. 1km
specifies a length scaled up by 1000.

Area is a kind of value. 1 sq m specifies an area. 1 sq cm specifies an
area scaled down by 10000. 1 hectare specifies an area scaled up by 10000.
Length times length specifies an area.

A volume is a kind of value. 1 cu m specifies a volume. 1cc specifies
a volume scaled down by 1000000. Length times area specifies a volume.

Laboratory is a room.

When play begins:
	say "The time is about [time of day to the nearest 5 minutes].";
	say "2174 to the nearest 25 is [2174 to the nearest 25].";
	say "51.82m to the nearest 3m is [51.82m to the nearest 3m].";
	say "square root of 16 is [square root of 16].";
	say "square root of 10240000 is [square root of 10240000].";
	say "square root of 1024 sq m is [square root of 1024 sq m].";
	let A be square root of 1024 sq m;
	say "squaring which gives [A times A].";
	say "cube root of 16 is [cube root of 16].";
	say "cube root of 26 cu m is [cube root of 26 cu m].";
	let T be cube root of 26 cu m;
	say "cubing which gives [T times T times T].";
