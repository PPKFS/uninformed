The Mysterious Void is a room.

Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green.

Affinity relates one colour to another.

The verb to scratch (he scratches, they scratch, he scratched, it is scratched, he is scratching) implies the affinity relation.

Disaffinity relates one thing to another.

The verb to clash (he clashes, they clash, he clashed, it is clashed, he is clashing) implies the disaffinity relation.

Red scratches blue.

The fish is a thing.

Instead of waiting:
	now the player clashes the fish;
	now red scratches green.

Instead of jumping:
	now red does not scratch green.

Instead of going north:
	if red scratches green, say "Red scratches green.";
	otherwise say "Red does not scratch green."

Test me with "n/relations/z/n/relations/jump/n/relations".
