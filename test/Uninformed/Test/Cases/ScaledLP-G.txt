Length is a kind of value. 1m specifies a length. 1mm specifies a length
scaled down by 1000. 1cm specifies a length scaled down by 100. 1km
specifies a length scaled up by 1000.

Area is a kind of value. 1 sq m specifies an area. 1 sq cm specifies an
area scaled down by 10000. 1 hectare specifies an area scaled up by 10000.
Length times length specifies an area.

A volume is a kind of value. 1 cu m specifies a volume. 1cc specifies
a volume scaled down by 1000000. Length times area specifies a volume.

Laboratory is a room.

Measuring is an action applying to one length. Understand "measure [length]" as measuring.

Carry out measuring: say "You measure out [the length understood]."

Test me with "measure 1.6cm / measure 1.62cm / measure 1.62km / measure 20mm /
measure 2mm / measure 25.0321km".
