Home is a room.

McWiggy is a man in the Home. A person can be happy or upset. McWiggy is 
happy.

The hat is in the Home. The hat is wearable.

Instead of touching McWiggy:
	now McWiggy is upset;
	say "Whoops, now he's upset."

Every turn when McWiggy has been upset for two turns: 
	say "He's been upset for two turns! He explodes!"
		
Before doing something when the hat has been worn:
	say "You've worn the hat at some point."
		
Before doing something when the hat has been worn for three turns:
	say "You've worn the hat for exactly three turns."

Test me with "wear hat / touch mcwiggy / z / z / z / z"
