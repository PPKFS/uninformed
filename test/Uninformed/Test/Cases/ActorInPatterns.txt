The Mysterious Void is a room. "Spooky." The Vast Nothingness is east
of the Mysterious Void. "Empty." The Nietzschean Abyss is east of the
Vast Nothingness. "Full of gazes."

Instead of an actor going east in the Vast Nothingness, say "Only
Ubermenschen may travel east from the Vast Nothingness."

Ayn Rand is a person in the Mysterious Void.

Every turn:
	say "Ayn Rand is now in [location of Ayn Rand].";
	if Ayn Rand is in the Mysterious Void begin;
		try Ayn Rand going east;
	otherwise if Ayn Rand is in the Vast Nothingness;
		try Ayn Rand going east;
		move Ayn Rand to the Mysterious Void;
	end if;

Test me with "actions/z/z/e/z/e".
