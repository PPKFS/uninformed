Once Upon a Time is a scene. Once Upon a Time begins when play begins. Once Upon a Time ends musically
when waving. Once Upon a Time ends bouncily when jumping.

When Once Upon a Time ends:
	say "This should happen second.";

When Once Upon a Time ends bouncily:
	say "This should happen first.";

When a scene ends:
	say "This should happen last.";

Test is a room.

Test me with "scenes/jump"
