"Chapter 14: Market" by Emily Short.

Chapter 14 - Units

Use command line echoing. Use scoring.

The Market is a room. 

Section 2 - Numbers
[A phenomenally tedious test of the various permitted syntaxes for arithmetic.]

When play begins:
	now the score is the score + 10;
	report the current score;
	now the score is 100 - the score;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score * 21;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score / 3;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score divided by 7;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score times 2;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score multiplied by 2;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score plus 2;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the remainder after dividing the score by 10;
	report the current score;
	now the score is the score minus 2;
	report the current score;
	
To report the current score:
	say "Your score is now [the score][if the score is less than 10]. That's not so great[end if][if the score < 2]. In fact, it's pathetic[end if][if the score > 20]. Well, could be worse[end if][if the score is greater than 100]. A lot worse[end if][if the score is 0]. Nice work, sparky[end if].";
	if the score is at least 300, say "You'll be famous soon!";
	if the score is at most 10, say "Your mom would be really disappointed.";
	if the score <= 360, say "360 is kind of a break-even point here.";
	if the score >= 360, say "Good thing you're at or above 360.";
	say "[paragraph break]".
	

A unit price is a kind of value. $1.99 per oz specifies a unit price.

A weight is a kind of value. 2lb 15oz specifies a weight with parts pounds and ounces (optional, without leading zeros). 

A cost is a kind of value. $1.99 specifies a cost with parts dollars and cents (optional, preamble optional). A unit price times a weight specifies a cost.

Section 3 - Whereabouts on a scale?

A spice is a kind of thing. A spice has a unit price. A spice has a weight.

Definition: a spice is heavy if its weight is 3lb 00oz or more.

Definition: a spice is light if its weight is 0lb 5oz or less.

Some saffron is a spice in the market. Saffron has weight 0lb 5oz. Saffron has unit price $35.95 per oz.

Some oregano is a spice in the market. Oregano has weight 3lb 1oz. Oregano has unit price $5.50 per oz.

Some cayenne pepper is a spice in the market. Cayenne pepper has weight 0lb 3oz. Cayenne pepper has unit price $2.00 per oz.

Section 4 - Comparing objects

Definition: a spice is costly if its unit price is $10.00 per oz or more.

Definition: a spice is moderate if its unit price is $8.75 per oz.

Definition: a spice is cheap if its unit price is $7.00 per oz or less.


Some rosemary is a cheap spice in the market. Rosemary has weight 0lb 3oz. 

Section 5 - Superlatives

Definition: something is unowned if the player does not have it.

Instead of taking a spice which is in the market:
	say "You have to buy things here."

Instead of buying a costly spice:
	say "Wouldn't you prefer some [cheapest unowned spice]?"
	
Instead of buying the cheapest spice which is in the market:
	now the player is carrying the noun;
	say "Good choice!"
	
Instead of buying a spice:
	now the player is carrying the noun;
	say "Done."

Instead of dropping the costliest spice carried by the player:
	say "Hey! You paid good money for that!"
	
Before dropping a spice when the weight of the noun is the weight of the heaviest spice carried by the player:
	say "Yeah, [the noun] is getting heavy..."

Section 6 - Units
[see above]

Section 7 - More on Specifications

2 pounds 15 ounces specifies a weight. 2 lb 15 oz specifies a weight.

Some fennel is a spice in the market. Fennel has weight 0lb 5oz. Fennel has unit price $8.35 per oz.

Section 8 - Multiple-number specifications
[See above.]

Section 9 - The parts of a number specification

Section 10 - Understanding specified numbers

Understand "price [weight] of [something]" as estimating.

Estimating is an action applying to one weight and one visible thing.

Check estimating:
	let available amount be the weight of the second noun;
	if the weight understood is greater than the available amount, say "Only [available amount] of [the second noun] is available for purchase." instead.

Carry out estimating:
	let total be the unit price of the second noun times the weight understood;
	say "[weight understood] of [the second noun] at [unit price of the second noun] would come to [total]."

Understand "pay [cost]" as paying.

Paying is an action applying to a cost.
 
	
Report paying:
	say "You fork over [the cost understood]."

[Section 11 - Limits on the size of numbers]

Section 12 - Arithmetic with units

Instead of examining a spice:
	say "[The noun] weighs [weight] and costs [unit price], or [unit price times 1lb 0oz] for a pound. The total price of the stock here would be [unit price times weight]."

Instead of smelling a spice:
	say "It smells like something that costs [weight  times unit price]!"


Section 13 - Multiplication of units
[See above also]

Section 14 - Totals

Before taking inventory when something is carried by the player:
	say "You are carrying [the total weight of spices carried by the player] worth of spices, for an average weight of [the total weight of spices carried by the player divided by the number of spices carried by the player]."
	
After printing the name of a heavy spice:
	say " (a generous quantity)"
	
After printing the name of a costly spice:
	say " (quite valuable)"

Section 15 - Making the verb "to weigh"

The verb to weigh (it weighs, they weigh, it is weighing) implies the weight property.

Some green tea is a spice in the market. It has unit price $8.75 per oz. It weighs 0lb 10oz.

The verb to cost (it costs, they cost, it is costing) implies the unit price property.

Some chicory is a spice in the market. Chicory weighs 0lb 4oz. It costs $1.99 per oz.
