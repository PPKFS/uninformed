A box is a kind of container which is closed and openable.
A sealed box is a kind of box which is not openable.
The Start is a room. "Here are [list of things which are not closed]."
The jewel box is a box. It is here.
The broken box is a box which is not openable.  It is here.
The secret box is a sealed box. It is here.

Test me with "open jewel box / open broken box / open secret box".
