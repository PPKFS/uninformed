"The Of Of Fear"

The Duke of Clarence is a room. "A fine public house in the 18th-century
style."

In the Duke of Clarence are a pack of cards and a set of wine glasses. The
description of the pack of cards is "A crudely-printed deck, stamped with a
cheap woodcut dipped in cheaper ink."

Instead of waiting in the presence of the pack of cards, say "You feel an
irresistable urge to gamble."

East of the Duke of Clarence is the Back of the Duke of Clarence.

The Back of the Duke of Clarence is north of the Garden of the Duke of
Clarence.

A Queen of England is a kind of woman. Eleanor of Aquitaine is a Queen of
England in the Garden of the Duke of Clarence. A Queen of England has a
text called point of view. The point of view of Eleanor of Aquitaine is
"That the Old French of 'of', the OF of 'of' so to speak, is 'de'."

Test me with "showme / east / south / showme eleanor".
