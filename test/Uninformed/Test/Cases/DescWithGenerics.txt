Home is a room.

A colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, green, blue,
yellow, orange and teal.

To announce (D - a description of sayable values):
	let L be the list of D;
	say "Today's random list is [L].";
	say "Today's random list is [the list of D]."

When play begins: announce all colours.
