Home is a room. Bob is in Home.

Factoring is an action applying to one number.

The best idea yet is a stored action which varies. The best idea yet
is the action of factoring 15.

The second best idea is a stored action which varies. The second best idea
is the action of asking Bob about "melon clusters".

When play begins:
	try factoring 16339;
	say "You consider [the best idea yet].";
	try the best idea yet;
	say "You then turn your mind to [the second best idea].";
	try the second best idea.

Carry out factoring: say "You factor [the number understood]."

Instead of thinking: say "You consider [the best idea yet]."; try the best idea yet.

Instead of jumping: now The best idea yet is the action of factoring 15.

Instead of going: now The best idea yet is the action of going east.

Instead of taking inventory:
	now the best idea yet is the action of asking Bob about "grapefruit pith".

Test me with "think / i / think / jump / think / e / think".
