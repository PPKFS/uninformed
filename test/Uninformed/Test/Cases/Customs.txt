"Customs"

Assaying is an action applying to one carried thing. Understand "assay
[something]" as assaying.

Carry out assaying: say "You assay [the noun]."

Rule for implicitly taking the curare:
	say "Ordinarily you'd pick up the curare in order to be able to do that,
		but this seems like a good moment for caution." instead.

The Evidence Room is a room. Some shelves are scenery supporters in the
Evidence Room. A box is a kind of container which is open and not openable.
On the shelves is a box. It contains a deformed bullet and a driver's
license.

The player carries a steel fish hook, a Chinese passport, a vial of
synthetic curare, and an envelope full of Euros.

In the Evidence Room is a Cloak of Distant Holding. The cloak is wearable.

The player-aware carrying requirements rule is listed instead
	of the carrying requirements rule in the action-processing rules.

This is the player-aware carrying requirements rule:
	if the player is wearing the cloak, continue the action;
	abide by the carrying requirements rule.

Test me with "actions / assay me / actions off / assay hook / drop hook /
assay hook / drop curare / assay curare / wear cloak / assay me".
