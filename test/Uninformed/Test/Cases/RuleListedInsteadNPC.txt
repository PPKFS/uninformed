The Mysterious Void is a room. "Spooky."

Cassie is a woman in the Mysterious Void.

Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion
succeeds.

This is the replacement can't go that way rule:
	say "Hi!";
    if stuck begin;
        rule fails; [ so the location of the player isn't changed ]
    end if.

The replacement can't go that way rule is listed instead of the can't
go that way rule in the check going rulebook.

To decide if stuck:
	decide yes.
[   (- GoSub_C8_Replacement() -).]

[ the following code is from Inform7/Extensions/Reserved/Verbs.i6,
with a call to "custom can't go that way rule" instead of the cant_go
property ]

[Include (-
[ GoSub_C8_Replacement i;
   i = parent(actor);
   if (go_with_vehicle) i = Room_Of(go_with_vehicle);
   if (go_to_location == nothing) {
       if (actor == player) {
           print "Whoo, you can't go that way.^";
           say__p = 1;
       }
       rtrue;
   }
   rfalse;
];

Test me with "u / cassie, u".
