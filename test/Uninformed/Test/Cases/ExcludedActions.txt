The Cave is a room. A creature is an animal in the Cave.

Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "talk to [someone]" as talking to.
Understand "talk to [something]" as talking to. 

Before doing something other than listening to or talking to or examining the creature: say "Something other than listening to or talking to or examining the creature."

Before doing something other than taking or dropping to the creature: say "Something other than taking or dropping to the creature.".

Test me with "look / take creature / drop creature / examine me / examine creature / listen to creature / push creature".
