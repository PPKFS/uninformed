Foo is a room.

Equation 1 - Malthus
	R = 2.0^T
where R is a number, T is a real number.

Equation 2 - Grandmalthus
	R = 2^T
where R is a number, T is a real number.

When play begins:
	let R be given by Malthus where T is 6.0;
	say "[R].";
	let R be given by Grandmalthus where T is 6.0;
	say "[R]."
