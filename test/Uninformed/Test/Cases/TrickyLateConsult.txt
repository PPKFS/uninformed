Frog is a room.

To decide if masculine:
	decide on whether or not the player's command includes "male/guy/he/man".

After reading a command when masculine:
	say "'masculine' triggered.";
	continue the activity.

After reading a command when the player's command includes "male/guy/he/man":
	say "'if includes' triggered.";
	continue the activity.

Test me with "x he / x guy / guy / male".
