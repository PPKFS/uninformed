Hunger is a room.

The cake is here. The cake is edible.

The harem girl is here. The harem girl carries the grapes. The grapes are edible.

The fungus is here. "Delicious fungus coats the walls." The fungus is edible
and fixed in place.

Madame Cholet is here. A dining table is here. A jam tart is on the table.
The tart is edible.

Instead of taking the tart:
	say "Madame Cholet smacks your hand away."

Test me with "eat cake / eat grapes / eat fungus / eat tart".
