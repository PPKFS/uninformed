The Study is a room. "A well-appointed study, with a large bookcase and an
equally impressive desk."

The equally impressive desk is here. It is scenery.

The large bookcase is here. It is scenery.

Understand "look behind [something]" as a mistake ("There's no need to look
behing anything in this game: EXAMINE and SEARCH should suffice.").

Test me with "look behind desk / look / look at desk".
