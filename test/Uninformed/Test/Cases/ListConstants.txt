The Brahms Conservatoire is a room. The tuba and the saxophone are in the
Conservatoire. Sally and Frieda are women in the Conservatoire.

Table of Really Hard Stuff To Do
task		subtask
"shopping"	{"going to shops", "choosing stuff", "paying for it"}
"cooking"	{"preheating oven", "unwrapping", "putting in oven", "setting time"}

A person has a list of objects called the revulsion list. The revulsion list
of Sally is {Frieda, the tuba}. The revulsion list of Frieda is {the saxophone}.

Instead of examining a person (called the subject): say "[The subject] is
clearly revolted by [revulsion list of the subject with definite articles]."

Instead of waiting:
	let S be {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64};
	let T be {2, 4, 6, 10};
	let U be {"genius", "brilliance", "ineffability"};
	let V be {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
	say "Begin with the sets S = [S in brace notation], T = [T in brace notation],
		U = [U in brace notation], V = [V in brace notation].";
	let Z be entry 2 of V;
	say "Z is [Z in brace notation].";
	add {6, 7, 8} to V;
	say "V is now [V in brace notation].";
	repeat with W running through V
	begin;
		say "In this repetition, W is [W in brace notation].";
	end repeat;
	let X be {the tuba, the saxophone};
	say "X is [X in brace notation].";
	repeat through the Table of Really Hard Stuff To Do
	begin;
		say "Task [task entry] involves [subtask entry].";
	end repeat;
	repeat through the Table of Really Hard Stuff To Do
	begin;
		sort the subtask entry;
	end repeat;
	repeat through the Table of Really Hard Stuff To Do
	begin;
		say "Reexamined, task [task entry] involves [subtask entry].";
	end repeat.

Test me with "z/x frieda/x sally".
