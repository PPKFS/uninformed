Home is a room. A signpost is in Home.

The signpost is either slightly crooked, very crooked, or straight.

The printed name of the signpost is "[signpost condition] signpost".

A colour is a kind of value. The colours are defined by the Table of Colours.

Table of Colours
Colour		Complement
black		white
white		black
red			cyan
green		magenta
blue		yellow
cyan		red
magenta		green
yellow		blue

When play begins: say "Today's colour is [complement of green]."

Instead of waiting:
	now the complement of green is black;
	say "Tomorrow's colour is [complement of green]."

Every turn:
	if the signpost is visible, say "The signpost is still [signpost
		condition], but who knows for how long?"

Test me with "z".
