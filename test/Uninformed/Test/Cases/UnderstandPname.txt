Home is a room.

The box is a container which is carried by the player.
It is openable and closed.

Understand the open property as referring to the box.

Understand "opened" as open.
Understand "shut/sealed" or "tightly sealed" as closed.

Test me with "x open box/x closed box/x shut box/x sealed box/x
tightly sealed box/open box/x shut box/x open box/x opened box".
