Home is a room. In Home are a can of shoe polish, a shoe polish
vending machine, a Polish sausage, and a Polish man. The sausage is
edible. The Polish man is a man.

Hallway is north of Home.

Does the player mean throwing the can of shoe polish at the vending
machine: it is very likely.

Does the player mean throwing the sausage at anything: it is possible.

Does the player mean throwing anything at anything: it is very
unlikely.

A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person.

Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.

Definition: a thing is selfish if it is part of the player and the
player can see an other person.

Does the player mean doing something when the noun is a selfish nose
or the second noun is a selfish nose: it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean tying something to the noun: it is unlikely.

Test me with "throw polish at polish / drop all / throw polish at man /
drop all / throw sausage at polish / x nose / get can and sausage /
n / x nose / tie can to polish / tie polish to sausage / tie polish to
polish".
