Maths Department is a room. "Try typing E.G. 2^3 to do some
number crunching."

A power is a kind of value. 3^9 specifies a power with parts base
and exponent.

A wibble is a kind of value. a^^^b, flob~flab, x\d\x and blob@blab are wibbles.

When play begins:
	say "a^^^b = [a^^^b], flob~flab = [flob~flab], x\d\x = [x\d\x] and blob@blab = [blob@blab]."


To decide which number is (b - a number) raised to the power of (e - a number):
    if e is 0, decide on 1;
    decrease e by 1;
    let b be b * (b raised to the power of e);
    decide on b.

Raising is an action applying to one power.
Understand "[power]" as raising.

Check raising 0^0: say "That is undefined." instead.

Carry out raising:
    let the answer be the base part of the power understood raised
    to the power of the exponent part of the power understood;
    say "The result of [power understood] is [answer]."

Test me with "3^4".
