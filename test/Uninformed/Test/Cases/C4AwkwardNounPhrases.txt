The Attic is a room.

In the Attic are a CD entitled No Smoke Without Fire, a 70s
photograph of an American winning Wimbledon, a fraxinus branch,
an urn holding your late great-aunt's remains, a convention badge
from the American Society of Hypertension and a ghost story by
M R James.

The shelf is in the Attic. On the shelf are Of Mice And Men and
The Girl From Ipanema.

A person can be asleep or awake.

Sleeping Beauty is a woman who is asleep in the Attic.

Beauty's croissant is a thing which is edible in the Attic.

Test me with "showme / showme beauty / showme croissant".
