The Brahms Conservatoire is a room.

When play begins:
	check sorting 1;
	check sorting 10;
	check sorting 100;
	check sorting 1000.

To check sorting (N - a number):
	say "Test of sorting the numbers 1 to [N] from a randomised order.";
	let L be a list of numbers;
	extend L to N entries;
	repeat with X running from 1 to N
	begin;
		now entry X of L is X;
	end repeat;
	say "L unrandomised is [L].";
	sort L in random order;
	say "L randomised is [L].";
	sort L;
	say "L in ascending order is [L]."
