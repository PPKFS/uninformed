"Toolcase"

The Kitchen is a room. "The kitchen is nice."

The toolcase is an openable container in the kitchen.
To recite (something - closed container):
    Say "The [noun] is closed."
To recite (something - open container):
    Say "The [noun] is open."
Instead of searching the toolcase, recite the toolcase.


Test me with "open toolcase / search toolcase / close toolcase / search toolcase".
