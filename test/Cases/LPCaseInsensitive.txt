Stage is a room.

A frequency is a kind of value. 100kHz specifies a frequency.

Tuning is an action applying to one frequency. Understand "tune to
[frequency]" as tuning.

Carry out tuning: say "You tune to [the frequency understood]."

Test me with "tune to 79kHz / TUNE TO 79KHZ / tune to 79khz".
