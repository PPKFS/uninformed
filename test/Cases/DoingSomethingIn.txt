Place is a room.

The radio is here. The radio is a device.

Hans is a man in the Place.

Instead of listening in the presence of the radio: say "Ugh."

Before doing something in the Place:
	say "Sure...";
	continue the action.

Before asking someone to try doing something in the presence of a person:
	say "Nope."

Test me with "listen / hans, take radio".
