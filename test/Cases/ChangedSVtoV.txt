"Stepping Through Changed Reciprocal V-to-V Relation"

Linking relates things to each other. The verb to link (he links, they link,
he linked, it is linked, he is linking) implies the linking relation.

AAA is a thing.
BBB is a thing.

CCC is a thing.
DDD is a thing.
DDD links CCC;

When play begins:
	now AAA links BBB;
	let count be the number of steps via the linking relation from AAA to BBB;
	say "AAA -> BBB - count = [count][line break]";
	let count be the number of steps via the linking relation from BBB to AAA;
	say "BBB -> AAA - count = [count][line break]";
	let count be the number of steps via the linking relation from CCC to DDD;
	say "CCC -> DDD - count = [count][line break]";
	let count be the number of steps via the linking relation from DDD to CCC;
	say "DDD -> CCC - count = [count][line break]";
			
The Stage is a room.

Test me with "relations".
