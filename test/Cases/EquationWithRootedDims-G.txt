Include Metric Units by Graham Nelson.

Equation - triangle theorem
  a = root (b^2+c^2)
where a is a length, b is a length, c is a length.

When play begins:
	let b be 10m;
	let c be 2m;
	let a be given by the triangle theorem;
	say a;
	showme the real square root of 4 sq m;
	showme the real square root of 2.
