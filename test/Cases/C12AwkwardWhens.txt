Home is a room. John is a man in Home. James is a man in Home.

Check telling it about when the noun is not John:
  say "Only speak to John." instead.

A flask is in Home. A parchment is in the flask.

The player is wearing a magic glove.

A rule for reaching inside the flask when the player is wearing the
magic glove: say "Your hand passes through the glass as if it were
not there, chilling you to the bone."; allow access.

Test me with "tell james about when / tell john about when /
push parchment / remove glove / push parchment".
