Home is a room.

Hanging around until is an action applying to one time.
Understand "wait until [time]" as hanging around until.

Carry out hanging around until: now the time of day is the time
understood.

Report hanging around until: say "All right. The time is now
[time of day]."

Waiting minutes is an action applying to one number.
Understand "wait [number] minutes" as waiting minutes.

Carry out waiting minutes:
	try hanging around until the time of day plus the number understood minutes.

Test me with "wait 10 minutes / wait 5 minutes".
