Home is a room.

A foobar is a kind of value. The foobars are foo and bar.

Understand "fooey" or "foozle" as "[foo-phrase]".
Understand "[foo-phrase]" as foo.

Frogging is an action applying to one foobar. Understand "frog [foobar]" as
frogging. Carry out frogging: say "Ah, frog the [foobar understood], then."

Test me with "frog foo / frog bar / frog fooey / frog foozle".
