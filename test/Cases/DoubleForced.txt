Trail Shelter is a room. Fred and George are men in Trail Shelter. The
possum, the skunk and the weasel are animals. Dixville Notch is north of
the Shelter. Earl is a man in Dixville Notch.

Suspecting relates various people to various people. The verb to suspect
(he suspects, they suspect, he suspected, it is suspected, he is
suspecting) implies the suspecting relation.

Earl suspects the possum.

Instead of waiting:
	say "A sinister odour begins to make itself felt.";
	now every person in Trail Shelter suspects every animal which is not suspected by Earl.

Test me with "relations / z / relations".
