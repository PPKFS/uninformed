Home is a room.

Exhibiting success is an action applying to nothing. The exhibiting
success action has a number called bar.
Exhibiting failure is an action applying to nothing. The exhibiting
failure action has a number called foo.

To announce (T - text): say T.

Carry out exhibiting success:
	now bar is 12.

Carry out exhibiting failure:
	now foo is 13.

Report exhibiting success:
	let B be bar;
	announce "Reporting [B]."
Report exhibiting failure:
	announce "Reporting [foo]."

Understand "good" as exhibiting success.
Understand "bad" as exhibiting failure.

Test me with "good / bad".
