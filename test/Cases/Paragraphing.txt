The Foreshore is a room. "This is the Foreshore."

The bucket, the ball and the starfish are in the Foreshore.

After taking the ball, say "It bounces up to your hand."

The Beach is south of the Foreshore. "A further sandy room."

The Sea is south of the Beach.

Every turn while the player is in the Sea, say "The wave washes up to your feet."

Every turn while the player is in the Sea, say "A crab scuttles by."

Test me with "LOOK / S / N / S / N / TAKE ALL / S / S / WAIT / LOOK".
