[The point here is the capital A in Athenians.]

Limbo is a room. Â Guy is a man in Limbo. 

Understand "Athenians/Spartans/Greeks" as "[Greeks]". 

Instead of asking Guy about "[Greeks]": say "He tells you about the Greeks." 
Instead of asking Guy about: say "He grunts." 

Instead of examining Guy: try asking Guy about "Athenians". 

Test me with "actions/ask guy about greeks/x guy"
