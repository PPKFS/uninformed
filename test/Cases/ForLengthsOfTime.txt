Noplace is a room.

A pebble is here.

Every turn:
	if we have examined the pebble for less than 1 turn, say "The pebble has been examined for less than one turn. "

Every turn:
	say "The pebble has been examined for ";
	if we have examined the pebble for 0 turns, say "zero";
	if we have examined the pebble for 1 turn, say "one";
	if we have examined the pebble for 2 turns, say "two";
	if we have examined the pebble for 3 turns, say "three";
	if we have examined the pebble for more than 3 turns, say "many";
	say " turns."

Test me with "z / x pebble / z / z / z / z".
