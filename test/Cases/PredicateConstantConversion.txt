Home is a room.

A posture is a kind of value. The postures are standing, sitting and lying.

A person has a posture.

Posture-allowance relates various things to various postures.

The verb to allow (he allows, they allow, he allowed, it is allowed) implies
the posture-allowance relation.

The armchair is in Home. The table is in Home.

The armchair allows sitting. The table allows lying.


Sitting on is an action applying to one thing.

Before sitting on something which does not allow sitting:
	say "That's not something you can sit on." instead.

Before sitting on something which allows sitting:
	say "That's something you can sit on." instead.

Understand "sit down on [thing]" as sitting on.

Test me with "sit down on armchair / sit down on table".
