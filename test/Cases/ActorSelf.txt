The spotlight is a room. Clark is here. Clark is a man.

Instead of doing something while off-stage:
	say "After the thrill of the spotlight, life seems not to exist."

Instead of Clark doing something while off-stage:
	say "After the thrill of the spotlight, life seems not to exist."

Instead of jumping:
	now Clark is off-stage;
	say "Clark vanishes with a surprised expression."

Instead of waiting:
	try Clark going east.

Test me with "look / wait / jump / wait".
