Place is a room.

A dial is a kind of thing.

A device called a timer is in Place. A dial called a graduated dial is part of the timer.

The block setting it to rule is not listed in any rulebook.

The setting it to action has a number called intended setting.

Setting action variables for setting something to something (this is the set numerically rule):
	now the intended setting is -1;
	if the player's command includes "[number]":
		now the intended setting is the number understood.

Test me with "actions / set dial to infinity / set dial to 3 / set dial to 5 / set dial to 20".
