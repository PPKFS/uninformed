Lab is a room.

LN1 is a list of numbers that varies. LN1 is {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Instead of waiting:
	let L2 be LN1;
	let L3 be LN1;
	repeat with X1 running through LN1:
		remove X1 from L2;
		now L3 is L2;
		repeat with X2 running through L2:
			say "Before removing X2 from L3, X2 is [X2].";
			remove X2 from L3;
			say "After removing X2 from L3, X2 is [X2].";
			repeat with X3 running through L3:
				say "[X1],[X2],[X3]."

LT1 is a list of text that varies. LT1 is {"a", "b", "c", "d"}.

Instead of jumping:
	let L2 be LT1;
	let L3 be LT1;
	repeat with X1 running through LT1:
		remove X1 from L2;
		now L3 is L2;
		repeat with X2 running through L2:
			say "Before removing X2 from L3, X2 is [X2].";
			remove X2 from L3;
			say "After removing X2 from L3, X2 is [X2].";
			repeat with X3 running through L3:
				say "[X1],[X2],[X3]."

Test me with "wait / jump".
