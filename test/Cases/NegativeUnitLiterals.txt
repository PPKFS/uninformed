An elevation is a kind of value. -100 cubits specifies an elevation.
Every room has an elevation.

The water level is an elevation that varies. The water level is -10 cubits.

The first every turn rule:
	say "Water level: [water level].";
	increase the water level by 2 cubits;
	if water level > elevation of location, say "The water has risen to the
		level of [water level]-- above your head!".

When play begins:
	say "Well, assuming this is a logical universe, you should have just
		enough time to finish this ark."

Beach is a room. The elevation of Beach is 2 cubits. A pile of lumber
and a hammer are in Beach.

Every turn when water level is at least elevation of location, end the
story saying "Somehow are you not surprised".

Test me with "z/z/z/z/z/z".
