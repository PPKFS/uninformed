The Upper Cave is above the Rock Pool.

When play begins:
	let M be 3;
	unless M is 2, say "M is not 2.";
	unless M is 1, say "M is not 1.";
	unless M is 3:
		say "M not 3.";
	otherwise unless M is 2:
		say "M may be 3, but isn't 2.";
	otherwise:
		say "Can never happen.";
	say "Rolled up: [unless M is 2]M is not 2.";
	say "Rolled up: [unless M is 3]M is not 3.[otherwise unless M is 2]M may be 3, but isn't 2.[otherwise]Whoops.";

Test me with "look".
