[To check that replacing rule X by rule Y when both are in the same rulebook
moves rather than copies X.]

The Lab is a room. The player carries a bat.

Check an actor dropping (this is the replaced rule):
	say "Replaced rule firing.";
	if the noun is in the holder of the actor:
		say "[The noun] is already here.";
		stop the action.

The replaced rule is listed instead of the can’t drop what’s already dropped
rule in the check dropping rules.

Test me with "drop bat".
