[The point is to check that activities do not apply the "region implicitly
means a room in the region" convention which actions do.]

The Decontamination Station is a room. A control panel is here. "Three
buttons -- red, blue, and green -- adorn the control panel in front of you.
A sign above the buttons reads: CAUTION: RADIATION PURGE."

A red button is part of the control panel. A green button is part of the
control panel. A blue button is part of the control panel.

The lower levels is a region. The access tunnels is a region. The
residential bays is a region.
 
Purging something is an activity.
 
Before purging a region (called the purged area), say "Initiating purge
protocols in [the purged area]..."
 
Rule for purging the lower levels: say "The lower levels have been purged."
Rule for purging the access tunnels: say "The access tunnels have been purged."
Rule for purging the residential bays: say "The residential bays have been purged."
 
After purging a region: say "Purge complete."
 
Instead of pushing the red button, carry out the purging activity with the lower levels.
Instead of pushing the green button, carry out the purging activity with the access tunnels.
Instead of pushing the blue button, carry out the purging activity with the residential bays. 
 
Test me with "push red / push blue / push green".
