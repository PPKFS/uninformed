Stage is a room. A rose is a thing in Stage.

Every turn: say "The rose has been visible for [if rose has been visible for
exactly 0 turns]0[else if rose has been visible for exactly 1 turn]1[else if
rose has been visible for exactly 2 turns]2[else if rose has been visible for
exactly 3 turns]3[else]? [end if] turns."

Test me with "z / z / z / z".
