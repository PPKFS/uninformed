The Cave is a room.

A large stone is here. "There's a very large stone here, in a small
clearing." The description is "It's a very large rock, with a thin,
slot-like opening in the top of it." The stone is a fixed in place,
opaque container.

A bead is in the stone. An axehead is in the Cave.

The taking action has an object called the former position (matched as "from").

Setting action variables for taking:
	now the former position is the holder of the noun.


After taking something from the large stone:
	say "Done."

Test me with "get all".
