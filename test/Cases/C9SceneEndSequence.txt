Home is a room.

Starting is a scene. Starting begins when play begins. Starting ends
roundly when the player carries the ball. Starting ends squarely when  
the player carries the cube.

The cube and the ball are here.

Ending is a scene. Ending begins when Starting ends.
When Ending begins:
	if Starting ended roundly, say "Roundly.";
	if Starting ended squarely, say "Squarely."

Test me with "scenes / take ball".
