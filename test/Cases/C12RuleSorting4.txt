The Empty Room is a room.

An every turn rule (this is the bell rule):
	say "The bell rule."

An every turn rule (this is the foo rule):
	say "The foo rule."

Every turn:
	say "This is neither the foo nor the bar rule."

This is the bar rule:
	say "The bar rule."

The bar rule is listed before the foo rule in the every turn rulebook.

The bell rule is listed after the foo rule in the every turn rulebook.

Test me with "wait".
