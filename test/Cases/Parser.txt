Schloss Parserhof is a room. "Begun by Mad King Ludwig in 1878, this grand foyer was
projected to be the antechamber to a long series of exotic chambers in which the Austrian
monarch could have parser antics performed before his eyes. Build on a north-south
spinal passage, it has been found monotonous by some architectural critics."

[Note that there is no Test me with... here; instead, a separate command script is
provided for this test case, so that the UNDO command can be used in the course of
tests. The intention is that each test or set of tests should be in its own room, each
south of the previous one.]

Section 1 - Discard UNDO Testing

The Discard UNDO Testing Place is a room south of the Schloss.

The bottle is here. The bottle can be broken or unbroken. 
The description of the bottle is "It's [if the bottle is broken]broken[else]unbroken[end if]."

Instead of attacking the unbroken bottle:
	say "Smash!";
	now the bottle is broken.

Section 2 - Too Few Error Testing

A cube is a kind of thing.

The Pea-green Boat is a room south of the Discard UNDO Testing Place.

The owl and the pussycat are in the Pea-green Boat. 

South of the Boat is the Shore. Six cubes are in the Shore.
