The Kitchen is a room. 
A red apple is in the Kitchen.
A red tomato is in the Kitchen. 
The microwave oven is an open, unopenable container, in the kitchen.
The brick oven is an open, unopenable container, in the kitchen.
Does the player mean inserting the apple into something: it is likely.
Does the player mean inserting something into the brick oven: it is likely.

Understand "put [things preferably held] aside/elsewhere" as dropping.

To foo bar: (- DB_Action_Details(action, noun, second); print "^"; -).
First does the player mean rule: say "n=[noun] s=[second noun]."; foo bar; make no decision.

Test me with "get apple and tomato / trace 2 / put red in microwave / put tomato in oven".
