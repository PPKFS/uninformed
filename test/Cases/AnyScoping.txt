Definition: a thing is seen if we have examined it.

Understand "[any adjacent room]" as going by name. Going by name is an
action applying to one thing. Carry out going by name: move the player
to the noun.

Understand "[any seen thing]" as remembering. Remembering is an action
applying to one thing. Carry out remembering: say "The last time you
saw that, it was in [location of noun]."

The basic accessibility rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Test me with "w / sword / wings / stage / wings / stage / x sword / sword".
