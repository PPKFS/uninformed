The Donut Shop contains a transparent closed openable locked lockable enterable container called a case. The case is fixed in place. The case contains some cake donuts, some jelly donuts, and some apple fritters. "The [if unopenable]damaged[otherwise]gleaming[end if] donut case [if something is in the case]contains [a list of things in the case][otherwise]has been stripped of its contents[end if]."

The can't reach through closed window rule substitutes for the can't reach inside rooms rule when doing something other than waiting and the person asked is the player and the person reaching is the player and the window is closed.

This is the can't reach through closed window rule:
	if the person reaching is the player, say "You can't reach through the closed window.";

    try examining the next room.


The window is a backdrop. It is in the Bagel Shop and the Donut Shop. The window can be openable. The window can be open. The window is openable and closed. Instead of searching the window when the location is the Donut Shop: try examining the Bagel shop. Instead of searching the window  when the location is the Bagel Shop: try examining the Donut Shop.

Instead of examining a room:
	if the player is in the Tire Shop, say "You can't very well do that." instead;
	if the noun is the Tire Shop, say "Fat Chance" instead;
    say "Over in [the noun], you can see [a list of visible things in the noun]."

            let space be the holder of the space;
        end while;
        let way be the best route from the space to the location, using even locked doors;
        if way is a direction

            try the victim trying going way;
        end if;

The forklift is a vehicle in the Donut Shop. Igg is a woman in the forklift. The gold ball is a passkey carried by Igg. It unlocks the round door. The description is "It is perfectly round and shiny."


After Igg trying unlocking something with something in the presence of Ogg:
    say "'Holy crow!' bellows Ogg[if Ogg is not visible] from the other room[end if]. 'I didn't know you could do that, Igg!'";
    continue the action.

Report Igg trying going to somewhere (called the destination) by forklift:
	if the player is in the destination, say "There is a tremendous rattling of [the list of fixed in place things in the location]."

	say "Ogg is forced to lift the dolly and sort of scooch it over the bottom of the doorframe."

Report Igg trying going to the Bagel Shop by forklift with the dolly:
 	say "A look of the most intense concentration occupies Igg's face as she tries to maneuver the dolly with the front tines of the forklift, without disturbing anything in the bagel shop. All the same, she does manage." instead.

Report Igg trying examining the forklift more than once:
	say "Igg ignores you this time, having gleaned all she wants to know about the forklift." instead.

Instead of Igg trying jumping in the Tire Shop:
	say "Igg jumps, shaking the towers of rubber until you fear they're all going to come tumbling down. But they don't.";
	the rule succeeds.

Instead of Igg trying singing:

	Carry out Ogg trying eating an edible thing:
		move the crumbs to the holder of Ogg;
		now the hunger of Ogg is 0.

		say "Ogg struggles a bit with [the second noun] in the lock of [the noun], but does eventually succeed. 'Hunh!' says Ogg.";
		stop the action.

	Carry out Ogg trying opening the case when the case has been open:
