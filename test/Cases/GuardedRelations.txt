Testing is a room.

An umbrella is here. A pear is here. The screwdriver is a device.

Blorbing relates various devices to one thing.
The verb to be blorbed into implies the blorbing relation.

Instead of inserting something into something:
	if the noun is blorbed into the second noun, say "Blorbed!";
	now the screwdriver is blorbed into the pear;
	now the noun is blorbed into the second noun.

Test me with "put umbrella in pear".
