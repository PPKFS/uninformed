The Formless Void is a room. "This is where I do dangerous coding."

A height is a kind of value. 5'11" specifies a height.

Every room has a height called ceiling height.

The ceiling height of the Formless Void is 28'6".

Instead of jumping:
	say "You jump to the maximum safe height of [ceiling height of the location]."

Test me with "jump".
