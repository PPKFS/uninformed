Someplace is a room.

Joe is a man in Someplace.

The player carries a sign.

Test string is a text that varies.

Before doing something when Joe can see the player:
	now test string is "[the action name part of the current action]";
	say "(test string = '[test string]')";
	continue the action.

Instead of doing something:
	if test string is:
		-- "jumping": say "'Oh, go jump in a lake!'";
		-- "waving": say "'Oh, wave off!'";
		-- otherwise: say "No idea."		
	
Test me with "x sign / give sign to joe / jump / wave sign".
