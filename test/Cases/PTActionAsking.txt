The Kitchen is a room. Will is a man in the kitchen. 

Cooking is an action applying to nothing. Understand "cook dinner" as cooking.

Instead of asking will to try cooking for the second time:
	say "Are you sure you wan't to ask will to cook dinner? He did it last
	night and he might get mad if you ask again."

Test me with "will, cook dinner / g / will, cook dinner".
