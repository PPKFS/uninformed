The Brahms Conservatoire is a room. The tuba and the trombone are in the Conservatoire.

The tally is a list of stored actions that varies.

Before doing something other than taking inventory:
	if the current action is listed in the tally, say "(Oh, not again!)";
	otherwise add the current action to the tally.

Before taking inventory:
	sort the tally;
	say "You have thus far tried the actions: [the tally]."

Test me with "look / wait / wait / take all / drop tuba / take me / take tuba / i / i".
