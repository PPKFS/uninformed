For printing a parser error when the best match is at least the first word:
	say "I only understood you as far as '[the best match]'. I don't know the word '[first word]'. (foobar is nothing: [foobar].)"

For printing a parser error when the best match is at least the first word and the foobar is not nothing:
	say "I only understood you as far as '[the best match]' ([foobar]). I don't know the word '[first word]'."

To decide which snippet is the first word: (- 101 -).
To decide which snippet is the best match: (- 101 -).

The foobar is an object that varies. The foobar is yourself.

spot is room.

After waiting: now foobar is nothing.

Test me with "hi / montelimar / asdf / z / what".
