Room called In Hallway is north of the Foyer.

An apple is in the Foyer. The description of the apple is "Looks yummy."

After deciding the scope of the player:
	if the location is In Hallway, place apple in scope;
	now Mike is Cahoots alongside Susie.

Cahooting relates one person to one person.

The verb to be Cahoots alongside implies the cahooting relation.

Mike and Susie are people in the Foyer.

Test me with "x apple / s / x apple".
