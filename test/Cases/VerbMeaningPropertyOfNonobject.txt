The Kitchen is a room. 

A material is a kind of value. The materials are metal, ceramic, and polymer.
A resistance is a kind of value. The resistances are brittle, hard, and soft.

A material has a resistance called the stiffness.

The verb to feel means the stiffness property.
Metal feels hard. Ceramic feels brittle. Polymer feels soft.

When play begins:
	if the stiffness of metal is hard:
		say "Yes (1).";
	if metal feels hard:
		say "Yes (2).";
