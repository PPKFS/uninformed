The Place is a room.

Bob is a man in the place. Sally is a woman in the Place. Rick is a man in the Place.

Persuasion rule for asking Bob to try jumping:
	say "'No way!' Bob declares.";
	persuasion fails.

Persuasion rule for asking Sally to try jumping:
	say "''Right,' says Sally.";
	persuasion succeeds.

Persuasion rule for asking Sally to try looking:
	say "''Right,' says Sally.";
	persuasion succeeds.

Instead of an actor jumping:
	say "[The actor] prepares to leap."

The goggles are in the Place. The goggles are wearable. A dance-name is a
kind of thing. Argentine tango, samba, merengue, cha-cha, street salsa are
dance-names.

Dancing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "dance [any
dance-name]" as dancing. Understand "dance" as dancing.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor dancing: 
	now the noun is street salsa.
	
Report someone dancing:
	say "[The actor] dances a few steps of [the noun] for you."
	
Report dancing:
	say "You dance a few steps of [the noun]."
	
Persuasion rule for asking someone to try dancing: persuasion succeeds.

Test me with "actions / wear goggles / jump / bob, jump / bob, look /
sally, jump / sally, look / dance / dance samba / rick, dance / rick, dance
merengue".
