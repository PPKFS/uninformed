The dome is a room.

The chap is a man in the dome.
The fruit is in the dome. The fruit scone is in the dome.
The fruit is edible. The fruit scone is edible.

Understand "notify [an edible thing] [someone]" as giving it to.

Does the player mean giving a fruit scone to the chap: it is likely.

Test me with "notify fruit chap".
