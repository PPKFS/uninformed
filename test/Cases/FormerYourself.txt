[A case by Kathleen Fischer. The point here is for the size property to be
available even to the unseen former player.]

Singing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "sing" as singing.

Check singing: say "Your singing is abominable."

A size is a kind of value. The sizes are small, medium, and large. A
thing has a size. A thing is usually medium.

The Junk Shop is a room.

A super bouncy ball, a tin soldier, and a stuffed mongoose are things
in the Junk Shop. The ball and soldier are small. The mongoose is
medium.

Lou is a person. He is large. He has description "A green hulking
brute with a heart of gold." The player is Lou.

Before singing:
	say "Everything, including [the list of things in The Junk Shop], cringe[s]
		at your pathetic efforts." instead.

Before jumping:
	say "[The list of small things in The Junk Shop] jump on the floor as well." instead.

test me with "x me / sing / jump".
