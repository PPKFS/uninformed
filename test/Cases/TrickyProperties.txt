Stage is a room.

Brightness is a kind of value. The brightnesses are guttering, weak,
radiant and blazing.

The player carries a candle lantern. The lantern has a brightness. The
lantern is blazing.

Temperature is a kind of value. 70C specifies a temperature.

A brightness has a temperature. The temperature of a brightness is
usually 700C. The temperature of blazing is 1400C. The temperature of
radiant is 1100C.

A brightness can be adequate or inadequate. A brightness is usually
adequate. Guttering is inadequate.

The player carries a book. The description of the book is "[if the
brightness of the lantern is adequate]Many secrets are now
yours.[otherwise]No, the print's too tiny by this awful light."

Instead of jumping, now the lantern is guttering.

The description of the lantern is "The lantern shines with a flame at
[temperature of the brightness of the lantern]."

Test me with "x lantern / read book / jump / x lantern / read book".
