The Library is a room.

The catalog card is in the Library. It has a list of text called
the note. The description of the catalog card is "It is yellowed with age."

The note of the catalog card is {"Rumpelstiltskin","Jacob and Wilhelm
Grimm","1812","Fairy Tales","398.21 GRI"}.

When play begins:
	say "N of the CC is [note of the catalog card]."

Instead of examining something (called the item):
	say "[description of item][paragraph break]On the catalog card you read:[line break][the note of the item vertically]".

To say (chosen list - a list of text) vertically:
	say "Cl is [chosen list].";
	repeat with current entry running through chosen list:
		say "[current entry][line break]".
