The Paris Theatre is a room.

The big box is a container in the Theatre. The box is open and openable.
The box is enterable and transparent. A red button is here.

Standard report waiting rule response (A) is "Jeepers, this is dull.".
The can't exit closed containers rule response (A) is "Wretched [cage].".

Instead of pushing the button:
	now the standard report waiting rule response (A) is "Gosh, this is dull.";
	now can't exit closed containers rule response (A) is "Pesky [cage].";
	say "Clunk!"

Test me with "z / enter box / close box / exit / open box / exit / push button /
z / enter box / close box / exit".
