The dome is a room.

The dog is a thing in the dome.

Scene1 is a scene. Scene2 is a scene.
Scene2 begins when the player is holding the dog.
Scene2 ends when the player is not holding the dog.
Scene1 ends when Scene2 ends.

When Scene1 ends, say "But this scene cannot start!"

Test me with "scenes/take dog/drop dog".
