The Kitchen is a room.
The apple is a thing in the Kitchen. The pear is a thing in the Kitchen.

Foo is a list of things that varies. Foo is initially {}.

A person has a list of things called touched-list. 
The touched-list of a person is usually {}.

When play begins:
	say "Caress";
	add the apple to foo;
	add the pear to foo;
	showme foo;
	say "Foo: [foo].";

Instead of touching:
	add the noun to the touched-list of the player;
	say "You have touched [touched-list of the player].";

Test me with "touch apple / touch pear".
