The arena is a room. "You're here to fight." The player is here.

The lounge is east of the arena.

Include action pattern parsing in the debugging log.

Attacking is attacklike behaviour.

Before attacklike behaviour or taking yourself:
	say "That's the spirit!"
	
Before doing something other than attacklike behaviour:
	say "No, you're here to FIGHT!"

Before attacklike behaviour in the lounge:
	say "A gentleman wouldn't."

Test me with "look / x me / take me / attack me / east / x me / take me / attack me".
