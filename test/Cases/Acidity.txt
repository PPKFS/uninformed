Laboratory is a room.

Acidity is a kind of value. pH 7 specifies an acidity.

When play begins:
	say "[pH 1] is not nice. Nor is [pH 14]."

Litmus-testing is an action applying to one acidity.

Understand "dip litmus in [acidity]" as litmus-testing.

Carry out litmus-testing: say "The litmus turns the right colour for [acidity understood]."

Test me with "dip litmus in PH 1 / dip litmus in ph 3".
