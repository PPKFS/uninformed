To decide if (portal - a door) is north-facing:
	let dir be the direction of portal from location;
	if dir is north, decide yes;
	decide no.

Ballroom is a room. Hall is a room. Marble door is north of Ballroom and
south of Hall. Marble door is a door.

Instead of waiting:
	repeat with D running through doors
	begin;
		say "D is [if D is north-facing]n-f[otherwise]not n-f[end if].";
	end repeat.

Test me with "z / open door / n / z".
