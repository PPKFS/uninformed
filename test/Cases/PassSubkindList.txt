[The point of interest here is that L, a list of people, is passed to a
phrase which expects a list of objects.]

Africa is a room.

David Attenborough is a person in Africa.

To decide what object is a random entry in (L - a list of objects):
	say "I'm randomising in list [L].";
	let I be a random number from 1 to the number of entries in L;
	say "My rnd is [I].";
	decide on entry I of L.

When play begins:
	let L be a list of people;
	add David Attenborough to L;
	showme L;
	let E be a random entry in L;
	showme E.
