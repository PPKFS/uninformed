A pot is a kind of thing. The red pot, the green pot, and the blue pot are pots carried by the player.

A pan is a kind of thing. The white pan, the black pan, and the gray pan are pans carried by the player.

Before listing contents when the location is the Kitchen:
	group pots together as "pots";
	group pans together as "pans";

To meta: (-
	objectloop ({-my:1}) {
		if (LT_Compare({-my:1}.list_together, 0) ~= 0)
			print (the) {-my:1}, ": ", {-my:1}.list_together, ": ", (TEXT_TY_Say) {-my:1}.list_together, "^";
	}
-).

Before listing contents when the location is the Dining Room:
	group pots together as the substituted form of "pots";
	group pans together as the substituted form of "pans";

Before listing contents when the location is the Living Room:
	let N be 1;
	group pots together as "implement-[N]";
	increment N;
	group pans together as "implement-[N]";

Before listing contents when the location is the Bathroom:
	let N be 1;
	group pots together as the substituted form of "implement-[N]";
	increment N;
	group pans together as the substituted form of "implement-[N]";

Every turn:
	say "Inventory: ";
	list the contents of the player, as a sentence;
	say "."

Test me with "i / e / e / e / e".
