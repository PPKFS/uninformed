Swearing obscenely is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "Beetlejuice" as swearing obscenely.

Instead of swearing obscenely for one turn: say "Wash you mouth out with soap."

Instead of swearing obscenely for two turns: say "Wash your mouth out with soup."

Every turn while swearing obscenely for one turn: say "'Hey, don't say that three times in a row.  Bad things happen.'"

Every turn while swearing obscenely for two turns: say "'Hey, doubly so.'"

There is a room.

Test me with "beetlejuice / beetlejuice".
