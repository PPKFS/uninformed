Stanford is a room. A status display is here. The status display has a
truth state called parity. "The sober status display reads '[parity of the
status display]'."

Judging is an action applying to one truth state.

Understand "yeah" as true.

Carry out judging:
	now the parity of the status display is the truth state understood.

Report judging:
	say "A bell pings, and the status display reads [parity of the status display]."

Understand "judge [truth state]" as judging.

Test me with "judge true / judge false / judge yeah / judge maybe".
