Test me with "bob/privacy/look/bob/south".

Northside is north of Southside. Aaron, Bob, and Charlie
are men in Northside. Player is Aaron. 

Definition: a person is NPC if it is not the player. 

Following relates people to each other. The verb to be
following implies the following relation. 

The last carry out going: now every person following player
is in the location.

Understand "[person]" as toggling follow. Toggling follow
is an action applying to one thing. 

Carry out toggling follow:
	if noun is following player:
		now noun is not following player;
	otherwise:
		now noun is following player;
	say "[list of NPC people following player] will attend you.
	[list of NPC people not following player] will not."

Understand "privacy" as ostracizing. Ostracizing is an
action applying to nothing. Carry out ostracizing: now
every NPC person not following player is in a random room
which is not the location; say "[list of every NPC person
not following the player] leaves the room."
