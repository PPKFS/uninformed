The Kitchen is a room. "Just a small kitchen."

A bottle is a transparent open openable container in the kitchen.

In the bottle is the whisky. The indefinite article of the whisky is "some".

Before doing something other than examining to the whisky when the bottle is
	closed and the whisky is in the bottle:
	say "(first opening the bottle)";
	silently try opening the bottle.

Instead of drinking the whisky for the first time:
	say "You take one sip, and feel it burn your tongue."

Instead of drinking the whisky:
	say "One sip was enough."

Test me with "close bottle / drink whisky / drink whisky".
