Place is a room. Otherwhere is east of Place.

The jumping action has an object called the current place (matched as "at").

Setting action variables for jumping:
	now the current place is the location.

Check jumping at the Place:
	say "You can be bothered."

Report jumping at the Place:
	say "You were bothered."

Instead of jumping at the Place:
	say "You can't be bothered."

Test me with "jump / e / jump".
