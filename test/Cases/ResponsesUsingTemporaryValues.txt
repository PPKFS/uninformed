Lab is a room. Mobile home is a room. The table is in the lab. The table is an enterable supporter.

The chair is in the lab. The chair is an enterable supporter.

The implicitly pass through other barriers rule response (A) is "(getting the hell off [the current home])[command clarification break]".

After waiting:
	now implicitly pass through other barriers rule response (A) is "(getting, my goodness, off [the current home])[command clarification break]";
	say "You resolve to be more civil."

Test me with "get on table / get on chair / wait / get on table / get on chair".
