Home is a room.

L is a list of text that varies. L is { "[the problem]" }.

To say the problem: say "This doesn't work."

A thing has a list of texts called the hint list.

Instead of examining something:
	repeat with H running through the hint list of the noun:
		say "- [H][line break]";
	say "And L is [L]."

An apple is in home. It is edible. The hint list is {"What can you do
with an apple?", "It's a kind of fruit, isn't it?", "It could perhaps
provide nutrition.", "Just [italic type]eat apple[roman type]."}.

Test me with "x apple".
