The Trampolinium is a room.

Before jumping: say "Before jumping."

Before jumping for the third time: say "Before jumping for the third time."

Before jumping for the second to third time: say "Before jumping for the second to third time."

Before jumping for at most the second time: say "Before jumping for at most the second time."

Before jumping for more than the second time: say "Before jumping for more than the second time."

Before jumping for less than the third time: say "Before jumping for less than the third time."

Before jumping for at least the third time: say "Before jumping for at least the third time."

Test me with "jump / jump / jump / jump".
