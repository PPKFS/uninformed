Home is a room.

A foobar is a kind of thing.

The generic foobar and the special foobar are foobars in Home.

Definition: a foobar is satisfied if it is held by the player.

Definition: the special foobar is satisfied if it is not held by
the player.

The description of a foobar is usually "[The noun] is
[if not satisfied]un[end if]satisfied."

Test me with "x generic foobar / x special foobar / take all /
x generic foobar / x special foobar".
