The Brahms Conservatoire is a room.

To sieve primes up to (N - a number):
	let the primes be a list of numbers;
	let the composites be a list of numbers;
	let I be 2;
	while I times I is at most N
	begin;
		if I is not listed in the composites
		begin;
			let J be I times 2;
			while J is at most N
			begin;
				add J to the composites, if absent;
				increase J by I;
			end while;
		end if;
		increase I by 1;
	end while;
	sort the composites;
	repeat with P running from 2 to N
	begin;
		if P is not listed in the composites, add P to the primes;
	end repeat;
	say "The primes up to [N] are [the primes]. The composites are [the composites]."

When play begins:
	sieve primes up to 100.
