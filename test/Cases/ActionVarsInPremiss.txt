The Mysterious Void is a room. The frog is in the Void.

Trevor is a man in the Void. Persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds.

Check an actor waving when the noun is not held by the actor:
	if the actor is the player, say "(first taking [the noun])[command clarification break]";
	silently try the actor taking the noun;
	if the actor is not holding the noun, stop the action.

Test me with "actions / wave frog / wave frog / drop frog / trevor, wave frog / trevor, wave frog".
