The Mysterious Void is a room.

Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green.

Affinity relates one colour to another.

The verb to scratch (he scratches, they scratch, he scratched, it is
scratched, he is scratching) implies the affinity relation.

Disaffinity relates one thing to another.

The verb to clash (he clashes, they clash, he clashed, it is clashed, he is
clashing) implies the disaffinity relation.

Red scratches blue.

The fish is a thing.

Instead of waiting:
	now the player clashes the fish;
	now red scratches green;
	now red is decoded as the player.

Instead of jumping:
	now red does not scratch green;
	now the fish is not coded blue.

Instead of going north:
	if red scratches green, say "Red scratches green.";
	otherwise say "Red does not scratch green."

Afterness relates one thing to one thing.  The verb to be placed after
implies the afterness relation.

B, C, and D are things. C is placed after B. D is placed after C.

Brighterness relates one colour to one colour.  The verb to be brighter than
implies the brighterness relation.

Blue is brighter than red. Red is brighter than green.

Codedness relates one thing to one colour.  The verb to be coded
implies the codedness relation.

The player is coded yellow. The fish is coded blue.

Decodedness relates one colour to one thing.  The verb to be decoded as
implies the decodedness relation.

Red is decoded as the fish.
