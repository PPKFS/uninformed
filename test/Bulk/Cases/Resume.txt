Foo is a room.

At 9:01 am:
	end the story saying "You have died".

At 9:04 am:
	end the story finally saying "Your privileges have been revoked".

When play ends when the story has not ended finally:
	say "You have been granted a reprieve!";
	resume the story.

Test me with "z / z / look / z / z / z".
