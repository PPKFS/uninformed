"Not Visited"

Include expressions and predicate calculus workings in the debugging log.

Start is a room. "You start here."

Room 1 is west of Start. "This is Room 1 and [self].[if not visited]You haven't
been here before.[end if]"

Room 3 is north of Start. "This is Room 3 and [self].[if visited]You have been
here before.[end if]"

Room 2 is south of Start. "This is Room 2 and [self].[if unvisited]You haven't
been here before.[end if]"

Test me with "verbose / n / s / n / s / w / e / w / e / s / n / s"

To say self: (- print "(Self is: ", (the) self, ") ";
	if (self has visited) print "(V) "; else print "(NV) "; -).
