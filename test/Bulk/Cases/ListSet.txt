The Brahms Conservatoire is a room.

When play begins:
	let S be a list of numbers;
	add 2 to S; add 4 to S; add 8 to S; add 16 to S; add 32 to S; add 64 to S;
	let T be a list of numbers;
	add 2 to T; add 4 to T; add 6 to T; add 10 to T;
	say "Begin with the sets S = [S in brace notation], T = [T in brace notation].";
	add 8 to T, if absent;
	sort T;
	say "Adding 8 to T gives T = [T in brace notation].";
	let I be T;
	repeat with element running through T
	begin;
		if element is not listed in S, remove element from I;
	end repeat;
	say "The intersection I = [I in brace notation].";
	let U be S;
	add T to U, if absent;
	sort U;
	say "The union U = [U in brace notation].";
	let D be S;
	remove T from D, if present;
	say "The set difference S\T = [D in brace notation].";
