"Tense Boxing"

The Temporal Lobe is a room.

The mysterious box is in the Temporal Lobe. It is an openable closed container.

To assess the box:
	if the box was not open, say "The box was not open.";
	if the box was open, say "The box was open.";
	if the box had not been open, say "The box had not been open.";
	if the box had been open, say "The box had been open.";
	if the box is not open, say "The box is not open.";
	if the box is open, say "The box is open.";
	if the box has not been open, say "The box has not been open.";
	if the box has been open, say "The box has been open."

Before opening the mysterious box:
	say "You are about to open the box.";
	assess the box.

Before closing the mysterious box:
	say "You are about to close the box.";
	assess the box.

After opening the mysterious box:
	say "You now open the box.";
	assess the box.

After closing the mysterious box:
	say "You now close the box.";
	assess the box.

Test me with "open box / close box / open box".
