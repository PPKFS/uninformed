Home is a room. Bobbette is a woman in Home.

A hat is a kind of thing. A hat is wearable. Bobbette wears a hat.
The homberg is a hat. The player carries the homberg.

Every turn:
	if no hat is not worn by a person, say "No hat is not worn by a person.";
	if a hat is not worn by a person, say "There is a hat which is not worn by a person.";
	if no hat is not enclosed by a person, say "No hat is not enclosed by a person.";
	if a hat is not enclosed by a person, say "There is a hat which is not enclosed by a person."

Test me with "z / drop homberg / wear homberg".
