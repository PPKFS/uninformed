To reach is a verb.

A rule for reaching outside containers:
	let T be the container in question;
	if the person reaching is Jack:
		say "([The person reaching] cannot reach through [the T].)";
		deny access;
	else:
		say "([The person reaching] [reach] through [the T].)";
		allow access.

When play begins:
	say "Jack tries to touch the rock...";
	try Jack touching the rock;
	say "Can Jack touch the rock? ";
	if Jack can touch the rock:
		say "Yes.";
	else:
		say "No."
