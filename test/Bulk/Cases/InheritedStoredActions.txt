The voting booth is a room. Bill is a person, here. Andy is a person, here.

A person has a stored action called order. The order of a person is
usually the action of waiting.

A person has a text called croz. The croz of a person is
usually "Splodgo [number of people]."

When play begins:
	say "Bill has [the croz of Bill] and Andy has [the croz of Andy].";
	say "Bill has [the order of Bill] and Andy has [the order of Andy].";
	now the order of Bill is the action of going up;
	say "Bill has [the order of Bill] and Andy has [the order of Andy].";
	now the order of Andy is the action of going down;
	say "Bill has [the order of Bill] and Andy has [the order of Andy].";
