The Balcony is a room. "Overlooking the great fountain below."
The bench is an enterable supporter in the balcony. 

The Garden is down from the balcony. The fountain is fixed in place in the
garden. The grass is in the garden.

After deciding the scope of the player when the player is in the balcony:
	if we have jumped:
		place the grass in scope;
	place the fountain in scope.

The player carries a key.

Test me with "get all from bench / get all from key / put key on bench / get
all from bench / put key on bench / get key from bench / jump / get all from
bench / get all from key / put key on bench / get all from bench / put key on
bench / get key from bench / put key on key".
