The Attic is a room. The old blue rucksack is a player's
holdall. The player is wearing the rucksack.

The carrying capacity of the player is 3.

In the Attic are a CD entitled No Smoke Without Fire, a 70s
photograph of an American winning Wimbledon, a polyfraxinus branch,
an urn holding your late great-aunt's remains, a convention badge
from the American Society of Hypertension and a ghost story by
M R James.

Test me with "get cd / get 70s / get branch / get urn / drop all /
take off rucksack / get cd / get 70s / get branch / get urn / drop all".
