The Grange is a room. A green Citroen, a fisherman, a brace of pheasants and
a topiary duck are here.

The player carries an E-bomb.

After dropping the E-bomb:
	say "There is an almighty explosion!";
	now the E-bomb is nowhere;
	repeat with item running through things:
		replace the text "e" in the printed name of the item with "*".

Use scoring.

When play begins:
	repeat with item running through things:
		say "[item]: [number of words in the printed name of the item] word[s]."

When play begins:
	now the score is 10;
	let X be "Your score is [score].";
	increase the score by 5;
	say X.

When play begins:
	now the score is 10;
	let X be "Your score is [score in words].";
	replace the text "e" in X with "*";
	increase the score by 5;
	say X;

When play begins:
	let X be "It's [time of day].";
	if X is substituted:
		say "Substituted: [X].";
	otherwise:
		say "Unsubstituted: [X].";
	replace the text "t" in X with "*";
	if X is substituted:
		say "Substituted: [X].";
	otherwise:
		say "Unsubstituted: [X].";

Test me with "drop all / look".
