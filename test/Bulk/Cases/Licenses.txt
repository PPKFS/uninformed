"Rules as Properties"

A document is a kind of thing. A document has a rule called the submission.

The player is in a room called Starter Room. A document called the license registration is in Starter Room.

This is the license submission rule:
	say "License has been submitted!"

The submission of the license registration is the license submission rule.

Instead of taking a document, follow the submission of the noun.

Test me with "wait / get registration".
