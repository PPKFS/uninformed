[Concatenation test.]

The Outer Solar System is a room.

To decide which text is the moon of the moment:
	decide on "Dione at [time of day]".

To decide which text is double (TB - text):
	say "Double.";
	decide on TB & TB.

To decide which text is (TB1 - text) & (TB2 - text):
	(- TEXT_TY_Concatenate({-by-value:TB1}, {-by-reference:TB2}) -).

Instead of going east:
	let Neptune be "Neptune";
	let Triton be "in retrograde motion about " & Neptune;
	say "Neptune is now [Neptune], Triton is [Triton]."

Instead of going west:
	let Neptune be "Neptune";
	let Triton be "in retrograde motion about " & Neptune;
	now Triton is double Triton;
	say "Doubled, Triton becomes [Triton]."

Instead of going north:
	let Neptune be "Neptune";
	let Triton be "in retrograde motion about " & Neptune;
	say "The join is: [Neptune & Triton]."

Instead of going south:
	let Neptune be an text;
	let Neptune be "Neptune";
	now Neptune is double double double Neptune;
	say "Octupled, Neptune becomes [Neptune]."

Instead of going up:
	say "Moon of the moment is: [moon of the moment]."

Test me with "n/s/e/w/u".
