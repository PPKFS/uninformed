Afterness relates one thing to one thing. Â The verb to be placed after
implies the afterness relation.

B, C, and D are things. C is placed after B. D is placed after C.

Instead of waiting: say "[the number of steps via the afterness relation
from D to B] [the number of steps via the afterness relation from D to
C] [the number of steps via the afterness relation from C to B].";

The Void is a room.

Test me with "relations / z".
