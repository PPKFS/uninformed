[Adapted from a bug report by Dave Chapeskie. The point is that hours are
scaled by non-power-of-10 amounts, making it impossible to print exact decimal
expansions in all cases.]

Lab is a room.

Table of Tests
input		duration
"1.5 hr"	1.5 hr
"90s"		90s
"1.5 min"	1.5 min
"60 min"	60 min
"1 hr"		1 hr
"90 min"	90 min
"12 hr"		12 hr
"1.5 days"	1.5 days
"18 hr"		18 hr

When play begins:
	[do one without using the table]
	let X be 1.5 hr;
	say "1.5 hr = [X] = [X in s] = [X in min].";
	[dump out some more]
	repeat through Table of Tests:
		let X be the duration entry;
		say "[input entry] = [X] = [X in s] = [X in min] = [X in hr] = [X in days]."
