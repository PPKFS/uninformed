The lab is a room.

The bench is a supporter in the lab.

The apple is an thing. It is on the bench.

The sandwich is a thing. It is on the bench.

The can of cola is a thing on the bench. The cola can be fizzy or flat. The
cola is fizzy.

Instead of taking the apple, say "[if the apple is on the bench]You really
shouldn't eat in the lab.[otherwise]This will never be printed."

Check taking the sandwich: say "[if the sandwich is on the bench]The
sandwich should really stay on the bench.[otherwise]It's best not to
interfere with experiments." instead;

Check taking the cola: say "[if the cola is flat]What's the
point?[otherwise]Oh, no! too much fizzing!" instead;

Test me with "take apple/take cola/take sandwich"
