Section 1 - What are activities?

A beverage is a kind of thing.

Instead of drinking a beverage:
	now the noun is nowhere;
	say "Mm, glug."


The silver platter is a portable supporter carried by the player.

A Coke is a kind of beverage. Seven Cokes are on the platter. A Sprite is a kind of beverage. Two Sprites are on the platter. A root beer is a kind of beverage. Three root beers are on the platter. A ginger ale is a kind of beverage. Five ginger ales are on the platter.

The souvenir hat is worn by the player.


The Exhibition Room is a room. The Storage Closet is a dark room. It is west of the Exhibition Room. A broom is in the Storage Closet.


The Simon Says Room is north of the Exhibition Room.

A picture is a kind of container. A picture is usually enterable, open, unopenable, and fixed in place. Before printing the name of a picture, say "[italic type]". After printing the name of a picture, say "[roman type]".

Bronzino is a picture in the Exhibition Room. Instead of entering the Bronzino, move the player to Bronzino Interior. The printed name of the Bronzino is "Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time". Understand "venus" or "cupid" or "folly" or "time" or "bronzino" as the Bronzino.

Holbein is a picture in the Exhibition Room. Instead of entering the Holbein, move the player to the Holbein interior. The printed name of the Holbein is "The Ambassadors".

The corkscrew is carried by the player.


A painting is a kind of room.

Understand "zip" as returning to home.

Returning to home is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out returning to home:
	move the player to the Exhibition Room.

Holbein Interior is a painting. "You're on display. 'Look at me, look at my goods.' That's what the other two are thinking, anyway.  You don't know whether you come out as well as they do: prosperous, successful, men of power and the world."

The blur is a thing in the Holbein Interior. "There's something at your feet, obscuring the neat pattern of the rug. A grey-brown blur that won't resolve into a shape no matter how you stare at it. Looking at it makes your stomach go askew." The description of the blur is "There's something wrong with it. Something wrong not just in the way it looks, but in the fact of its existence at all. It both frightens and offends."


Bronzino Interior is a painting. "The first thing you notice is how little room there is in here. You're pushed right out at the edge, near the frame. There's not so much light where you are. It's hard not to resent those careless happy figures in the center when you're pushed back here in obscurity, elbow to elbow with...

Yes. It's not an illusion. The girl's body does taper off into a snake. Though she's smiling, though she's not looking at you, you know she knows you're staring and she hates you for it.

You redirect your attention to more pleasant things. The shining ball in the hand of Venus. [if the mask is in Bronzino Interior]The mask on the floor. [end if]Cupid's ruddy cheek, smoother than mortal flesh could be."

Cupid is a man in Bronzino Interior. He is scenery. The description of Cupid is "He has all his mother's attention. In fact, there's something a little incestuous about his hand on her breast. Or is that just infant innocence? It's hard to make sense of gestures in the usual way because, after all, these people aren't people but constructs."

The mask is a wearable thing in the Bronzino Interior. The description is "It looks about your size."

Venus is a woman in Bronzino Interior. She is scenery. The description of Venus is "Despite the careful rendering there's something slickly repellent about her. She doesn't notice the others, the lurkers pressing around you."

Venus is carrying a shining golden ball. The description of the ball is "It shares the primitive appeal of all things that gleam. But it stubbornly refuses to reflect its context."

Father Time is a man in Bronzino Interior. He is scenery. The description is "An old man with a long grasp."

Folly is a woman in Bronzino Interior. She is scenery. Understand "girl" or "snake" as Folly. The description of Folly is "She's got a nice face.  The rest is better not considered."

Instead of doing something except examining to Folly:
	say "She doesn't look at you, but her mind touches yours, and it is an experience you would prefer not to repeat. All the things you have done and regretted, all the petty cruelties, all the embarrassing moments driven by an ill-considered desire come back in a tide of chagrin."

Instead of asking Folly to try taking the golden ball when the ball is carried by Venus:
	say "'Who do you think gave it to her in the first place?'"

A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is always enterable. A chair is usually fixed in place. The bench is a chair in the exhibition room.
