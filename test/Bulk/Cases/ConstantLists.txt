Pisa is a Room.

The pen is here. The blotter is here. The ball is here.

a1 is a list of objects that varies. a1 is {pen, blotter}.

Before taking something interesting:
	say "(an interesting choice of object) ".

Definition: a thing is interesting if it is listed in {pen, blotter}.

Leonardo Fibonacci is a man in Pisa.

Sequencing is an action applying to one number. Understand "sequence [number]" as sequencing.

Persuasion rule for asking Leonardo to try sequencing: persuasion succeeds.

Report Leonardo sequencing:
	let N be the number understood;
	say "Leonardo offers [the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence]."

 To decide what list of numbers is the first (F - a number) terms of the Fibonacci sequence:
	let the Fibonacci sequence be {1, 1};
	let N be 3;
	while N < F:
		let the last term be entry (N - 1) of the Fibonacci sequence;
		let the penultimate term be entry (N - 2) of the Fibonacci sequence;
		let the next term be the last term plus the penultimate term;
		add the next term to the Fibonacci sequence;
		increase N by 1;
	decide on the Fibonacci sequence.

Test me with "leonardo, sequence 20 / get all".
