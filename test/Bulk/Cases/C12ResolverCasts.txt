The Study is a room. The duck is in the Study.

Instead of taking something (called the item):
	write "Monkeys ate my guava" for the item;
	xwrite "Monkeys stole my cheese" for the item;

To write (t - text) for (p - a thing):
	say "t is: [t].".

To xwrite (t - text) for (p - object):
	say "t is: [t].".

Test me with "take duck".
