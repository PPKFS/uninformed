Foo is a region. The Lab is in Foo. The Corridor is south of the Lab.

Barring is an action applying to one visible thing.

Understand "bar [any region]" as barring.

Instead of barring foo: say "Foo barred."

Before going in foo: say "Going in Foo now."

Before going to foo: say "Going to Foo now."

Before going from foo: say "Going from Foo now."

Before going in Corridor: say "Going in Corridor now."

Before going to Corridor: say "Going to Corridor now."

Before going from Corridor: say "Going from Corridor now."

Test me with "actions / bar foo / s / n".
