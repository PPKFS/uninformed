Home is a room.

A colour is a kind of value. The colours are defined by the Table of Colours.

Table of Colours
Colour		Complement
black		white
white		black
red		cyan
green		magenta
blue		yellow
cyan		red
magenta		green
yellow		blue

When play begins: say "Today's colour is [complement of green]."

Instead of waiting:
	now the complement of green is black;
	say "Tomorrow's colour is [complement of green]."

Test me with "z".
