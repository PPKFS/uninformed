"Ah, Spring"

Ranking it as is an action applying to one visible thing and one number.
Understand "give [something] [number]" as ranking it as.

Carry out ranking it as: say "You mentally give [the noun] a rating of
[the number understood]."

The Park is a room.  A woman called Elaine is here.  The player is
carrying some flowers.

Test me with "give Elaine 10 / give Elaine flowers / give Elaine ring
/ give flowers 8 / give flowers Elaine".
