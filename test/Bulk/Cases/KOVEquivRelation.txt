Zot is a room.

A posture is a kind of value. The postures are seated, standing, and reclining.

Drivel relates postures to each other in groups.

The verb to blob (he blobs, they blob, he blobbed) implies the drivel relation.

Seated blobs reclining.

Instead of waiting:
	now reclining blobs standing;
	say "now reclining blobs standing."

Instead of jumping:
	now reclining does not blob seated;
	say "now reclining does not blob seated."

Test me with "relations / z / relations / jump / relations".
