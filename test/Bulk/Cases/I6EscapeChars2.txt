The Gallery of Lexical Monstrosities is a room.

Bastard is a kind of value. The bastards are @@@, ^'^, mayn't, 'do', 'cha' 'cha',
~ and ~@^.

The boy x girl, the b@t, the ~~ and the flo^flo are in the Gallery.

When play begins:
	say "mayn't is [mayn't].";
	say "'do' is ['do'].";
	say "'cha' 'cha' is ['cha' 'cha'].";
	say "@@@ is [@@@].";
	say "^'^ is [^'^].";
	say "~@^ is [~@^].";

Provoking is an action applying to one bastard. Understand "provoke [bastard]"
as provoking. Carry out provoking: say "You provoke the [bastard understood]."

Understand "/" as taking inventory.

Understand "x^x" as taking inventory.

Test me with "x x / x b@t / x ~~ / x flo^flo / [/] / x^x / provoke @@@ /
provoke ^[']^ / provoke mayn[']t / provoke [']do['] / provoke [']cha['] [']cha['] /
provoke ~ / provoke ~@^".
