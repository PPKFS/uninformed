The Mysterious Void, the Unknowable Vastness, and the Nothingness are
rooms. The Empty Space is a region. The Mysterious Void, Unknownable
Vastness, and Nothingness are in the Empty Space.

Every turn:
	if the location provides the property map region begin;
		let R be the map region of the location;
		say "This is iteration over region [R] with the region stored as a variable.";
		repeat with P running through the rooms regionally in R begin;
			say "  [P] is in that region.";
		end repeat;
	end if;
	say "This is the iteration over region Empty Space with the region referred to directly.";
	repeat with P running through the rooms regionally in the Empty Space
	begin;
		say "  [P] is in that region.";
	end repeat.

Test me with "z".
