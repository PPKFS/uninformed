A phonodisk is a kind of thing. A phonodisk has a text called song.
A subject is a kind of thing.

The Study is a room.
The black box is an openable container in the Study.
The black button is part of the black box.

The record is a phonodisk in the Study. The song is "God Save the Queen".

After pushing the black button when the black box contains a phonodisk
(called the source):
	say "The black box plays [the song of the source]."

The two source hypothesis is a subject.

Test me with "take record/put it in black box/push button".
