A block is a kind of thing. A block has a number called size.

After taking a block: say "You take [the noun]." instead.

To decide if (X - a lit block) is larger than (Y - a block):
	if the size of X is greater than the size of Y, decide yes;
	decide no.

Before taking a block:
	if a container (called B) carried by the player is larger than the noun begin;
		try dropping B;
	end if.

The Example is a room. The green block, the red block, and the blue
block are blocks in the Example.

The size of the red block is 50. The size of the blue block is 40. The
size of the green block is 30.
