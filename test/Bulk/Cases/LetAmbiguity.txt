[This catches a subtle case in the type-checker, where the kind of value
of N is possible to misinterpret as a time, due to ambiguities in "after".]

Home is a room. A robot is here. The robot carries a sandwich and an umbrella.

When play begins:
	let F be the first thing held by the robot;
	say "F is [F].";
	let N be the next thing held after F;
	say "N is [N]."
