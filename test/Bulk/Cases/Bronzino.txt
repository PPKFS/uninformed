Guest Bedroom is a room.

The tapestry is scenery in the Guest Bedroom. The description of the
tapestry is "It is hard to make out the story from the faded threads, but
it appears to show a very small man, almost a dwarf, who holds on a leading
string a very large demon, almost a god." Understand "demon" or "dwarf" or
"god" or "man" as tapestry.

[The following mustn't be read as "empty" + "Guest Bedroom".]

The Empty Bedroom is southeast of the Private Parlor. "Like a monk's
chamber compared to every other part of the palace, just bare walls now.
Here your father stayed, when he made his ill-fated journey to the castle.
The Beast told you this, on your first visit."
