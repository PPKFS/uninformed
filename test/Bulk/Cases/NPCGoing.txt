B is west of C.  Magnet Man is a man in B.

Persuasion rule for asking Magnet Man to try going: persuasion succeeds.

After Magnet Man trying going:
	if the location of Magnet Man is not the location of the player begin;
		say "You find yourself mysteriously drawn along.";
		move the player to the location of Magnet Man;
	end if.

test me with "magnet man, go east".
