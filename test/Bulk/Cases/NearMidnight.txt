The fast time rule is listed before the timed events rule in the turn sequence rules.
The advance time rule is not listed in the turn sequence rules.
This is the fast time rule:
	increment the turn count;
	increase the time of day by 15 minutes.
When play begins: now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".
The Temporal Hot Spot is a room.
The time of day is 11:45 PM.
At 11:58 PM: say "Two turtles run by, almost too fast to see."
At 12:02 AM: say "The grass grows."
Test me with "z / z".
