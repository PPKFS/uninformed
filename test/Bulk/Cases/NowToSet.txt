"Now to Set Torne's Variables"

World is a room. Include predicate calculus workings in the debugging log.

Cheese is a kind of value. The cheeses are parmesan and cheddar.

The wobbly number is a number which varies.

The cheese de jour is a cheese which varies.

The rhetorical yes rule is a rule which varies. The rhetorical yes rule 
is the hmm rule. 

This is the hmm rule:
	say "Hmm.";
	now the carrying capacity of the player is 6;
	now the wobbly number is 6;
	now the cheese de jour is parmesan;
	now the rhetorical yes rule is the ahh rule;
	say "CCOP: [carrying capacity of the player]; WN: [wobbly number];
		RYR: [rhetorical yes rule]; CDJ: [cheese de jour]."

This is the ahh rule:
	say "Ahh.";
	now the carrying capacity of the player is 7;
	now the wobbly number is 5;
	now the cheese de jour is cheddar;
	now the rhetorical yes rule is the hmm rule;
	say "CCOP: [carrying capacity of the player]; WN: [wobbly number];
		RYR: [rhetorical yes rule]; CDJ: [cheese de jour]."

Instead of saying yes, abide by the rhetorical yes rule. 

Test me with "yes / yes / yes".
