There is a room.

A testval is a kind of value. 1tv99 specifies a testval with parts firstpart and secondpart.

The verb to be beyond means the containment relation.

To decide whether (X - testval) is beyond (Y - testval):
	if the firstpart part of X is greater than the secondpart part of Y, yes;
	no.

To decide whether (X - testval) is less than (Y - testval):
	if the firstpart part of X is greater than the secondpart part of Y, yes;
	no.
