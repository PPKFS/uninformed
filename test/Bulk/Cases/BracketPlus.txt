Laboratory is a room. The bench is here. The isotope is on the bench.
The sack of pitchblende is here.

Definition: a thing is radioactive if it is the isotope.

The Geiger counter is a number that varies.

To say the Lab name:
	(- DefArt( (+ Laboratory +) ); -).

To tick:
	(- (+ Geiger counter +) ++; -).

To watch the dial:
	(- print (+ Geiger counter +), "^"; -).

To say the survey of things:
	(- objectloop ({-my:1} ofclass (+ thing +)) DefArt({-my:1}); -).

To decide if (T - a thing) radiates:
	(- ( (+ radioactive +)({T}) ) -).

To decide if (T - a thing) helps:
	(- ( {T} ofclass (+ supporter +) ) -).

To decide if (T - a thing) helps:
	(- ( {T} ofclass (+ supporter +) ) -).

To decide if (T - a thing) sacks:
	(- ( {T} == (+ sack of pitchblende +) ) -).

To demonstrate vals:
	(- print (+ 253 +), " and ",
		(PrintTimeOfDay) (+ 11:32 PM +), " and ",
		(TEXT_TY_Say) (+ "some text about it being [time of day] right now" +), "^";
	-).

When play begins:
	say "Should be in [the Lab name].";
	showme the Geiger counter;
	tick;
	tick;
	tick;
	showme the Geiger counter;
	watch the dial;
	say "All smooshed together are [the survey of things].";
	repeat with T running through things:
		if T radiates:
			say "[T] radiates!";
		otherwise:
			say "[T] is safe.";
	repeat with T running through things:
		if T helps:
			say "[T] helps!";
		otherwise:
			say "[T] is no help.";
	repeat with T running through things:
		if T sacks:
			say "[T] is a sack!";
		otherwise:
			say "[T] is not a sack.";
	demonstrate vals.
