The Brahms Conservatoire is a room.

To decide what list of numbers is the first (F - a number) terms of the Fibonacci sequence:
	let the Fibonacci sequence be {1, 1};
	let N be 3;
	while N < F
	begin;
		let the last term be entry (N - 1) of the Fibonacci sequence;
		let the penultimate term be entry (N - 2) of the Fibonacci sequence;
		let the next term be the last term plus the penultimate term;
		add the next term to the Fibonacci sequence;
		increase N by 1;
	end while;
	decide on the Fibonacci sequence.

When play begins:
	say "The Fibonacci sequence is [the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence]."
