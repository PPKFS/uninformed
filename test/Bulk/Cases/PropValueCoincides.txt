Right here is a room. 

Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, white, green and blue.

A scene has a colour.

Abba Concert is a scene.
AC-DC Concert is a recurring scene.
Black Sabbath Concert is a scene.

Yes Concert is a scene.
A scene is usually white.
Steeleye Span Concert is a blue scene.
The AC-DC Concert is blue.
The colour of the Black Sabbath Concert is red.

When play begins:
	repeat with C running through scenes:
		say "[C] has colour [colour of C]."

Instead of waiting:
	now every scene is green;
	now Steeleye Span Concert is red;
	repeat with C running through scenes:
		say "[C] has colour [colour of C]."

Test me with "z".
