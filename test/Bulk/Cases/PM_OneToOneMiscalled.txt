"Testcase" by Andrew Plotkin

The Kitchen is a room.

A trigger is a kind of thing. A remote is a kind of thing.

Transmission relates one remote to one trigger (called the target). The
verb to notify (it notifies, they notify, it notified, it is notified,
it is notifying) implies the transmission relation.

The verb to be aimed at implies the transmission relation.

The squeaker and the squawker are remotes in the Kitchen.
The bell and the whistle are triggers in the Kitchen.

The squeaker notifies the bell. The squawker notifies the whistle.

Before taking a remote (called item):
	Let zog be the target of the noun;
	Say "The [item] notifies [zog]."
