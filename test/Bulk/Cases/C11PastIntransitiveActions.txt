Home is a room.

Every turn when we have taken inventory: say "You sure are glad that
your inventory is in order!"

Every turn when we have waited: say "Time keeps dragging on."

The block waking up rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Report waking up: say "You are now wide awake."

Every turn when we have woken up: say "It's good that you're awake
too."

Test me with "actions / i / z / wake up / z / z"
