Elapsed time is a kind of value. 1s specifies an elapsed time scaled at 100.

Electric current is a kind of value. 1A specifies an electric current. 1mA
specifies an electric current scaled down by 1000.

Electric charge is a kind of value. 1C specifies an electric charge scaled at 1000.
Elapsed time times electric current specifies an electric charge.

Laboratory is a room.

Equation 1
Q = It
where Q is an electric charge, I is an electric current, t is a number.
