Street is a room. "There is a nasty looking bar east of here." Bar is
east of Street.

Setup is a scene. Setup begins when play begins. Setup ends when
location is Bar.

Punchline is a scene. Punchline begins when Setup is not happening.
When Punchline begins, say "Ouch! You wham your head against the nasty
bar. Ducking this time, you manage to enter the drinking
establishment."

Test me with "scenes / e".
