Place is a room.

Bob is a man in Place.

Table of Remapped Inquiries
Topic	Alternate Action
"home/here"	the action of asking Bob about "shack"
"his home/shack/life"	the action of asking Bob about "shack"
"life in shack/home"	the action of asking Bob about "shack"
"acrobatics"	the action of jumping

After asking Bob about "shack" (this is the Bob approves rule):
	say "'I like it all right,' Bob drawls."

Instead of asking Bob about a topic listed in the Table of Remapped Inquiries (this is the a different 
approach for topic rerouting rule):
	try the alternate action entry instead.

Test me with "actions / ask bob about shack / ask bob about acrobatics / ask bob about home"
