Mrs Luxor's Home is a room.

The ceramic dog and the carved walrus are on the high shelf. The high shelf
is in Mrs Luxor's Home.

For choosing notable locale objects:
	if the player is not on the chair, now everything on the shelf is mentioned;
	continue the activity.

The chair is an enterable supporter in the Home.

For printing a locale paragraph about the chair:
	if the player is not on the chair
	begin;
		say "To sit might be to squish [the Donut].";
	end if;
	continue the activity.

The Versace clutch, the Boston Krispy Kreme Donut and the Guitar Hero CD
are on the chair.

Test me with "look / get on chair / look".
