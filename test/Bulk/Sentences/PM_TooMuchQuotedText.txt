syntax-test: Too much text in quotation marks: "It was really most extraordinary.There was Philip Mannering, doing his best to puzzle out algebra problems,
lying full-length under a tree with nobody near him at all - and yet he could
hear a voice speaking to him most distinctly.'Can't you shut the door, idiot?' said the voice, in a most impatient tone.
'And how many times have I told you to wipe your feet?'Philip sat up straight and took a good look round for the third time - but
the hillside stretched above and below him, completely empty of any boy,
girl, man or woman.'It's so silly,' said Philip to himself. 'Because there is no door to shut,
and no mat to wipe my feet on. Whoever is speaking must be perfectly mad.
Anyway, I don't like it. A voice without a body is too queer for anything.'A small brown nose poked up out of Philip's jersey collar. It belonged to a
little brown mouse, one of the boy's many pets. Philip put up a gentle hand
and rubbed the tiny creature's head. Its nose twitched in delight.'Shut the door, idiot!' roared the voice from nowhere. 'And don't sniff.
Where's your handkerchief?'This was too much for Philip. He roared back.'Shut up! I'm not sniffing. Who are you, anyway?'There was no answer. Philip felt very puzzled. It was uncanny and peculiar.
Where did that extraordinary voice with its rude commands come from, on
this bright, sunny but completely empty hillside? He shouted again.'I'm working. If you want to talk, come out and show yourself.''All right, Uncle,' said the voice, speaking unexpectedly in a very
different tone, apologetic and quiet.'Gosh!' said Philip. 'I can't stand this. I'll have to solve the mystery.
If I can find out where the voice comes from, I may find its owner.' He
shouted again. 'Where are you? Come out and let me see you.''If I've told you once I've told you a dozen times not to whistle,'
answered the voice fiercely. Philip was silent with astonishment. He hadn't
been whistling. Evidently the owner of the voice must be completely mad.
Philip suddenly felt that he didn't want to meet this strange person. He
would rather go home without seeing him.He looked carefully round. He had no idea at all where the voice came from,
but he rather thought it must be somewhere to the left of him. All right,
he would go quietly down the hill to the right, keeping to the trees if he
could, so that they might hide him a little.He picked up his books, put his pencil into his pocket and stood up
cautiously. He almost jumped out of his skin as the voice broke out into
cackles of laughter. Philip forgot to be cautious and darted down the
hillside to the shelter of a clump of trees. The laughter stopped suddenly.Philip stood under a big tree and listened. His heart beat fast. He wished
he was back at the house with the others. Then, just above his head, the
voice spoke again.'How many times have I told you to wipe your feet?'Then there came a most unearthly screech that made poor Philip drop his
books in terror. He looked up into the tree nearby, and saw a beautiful
parrot, scarlet and grey, with a big crest on its head that it worked up
and down. It gazed at Philip with bright black eyes, its head on one side,
its curved beak making a grating noise.Philip stared at the parrot and the parrot stared back. Then the bird
lifted up a clawed foot and scratched its head very thoughtfully, still
raising and lowering its crest. Then it spoke.'Don't sniff,' it said, in a conversational tone. 'Can't you shut the door,
idiot? Where are your manners?''Golly!' said Philip, in amazement. 'So it was you talking and shouting and
laughing! Well - you gave me an awful fright.'The parrot gave a most realistic sneeze. 'Where's your handkerchief?' it
said.Philip laughed. 'You really are a most extraordinary bird,' he said. 'The
cleverest I ever saw. Where have you escaped from?'Philip stood under a big tree and listened. His heart beat fast. He wished
he was back at the house with the others. Then, just above his head, the
